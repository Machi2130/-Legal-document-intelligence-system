Via the instant \nappeal, the appellant/revenue seeks to assail the order dated 21.12 .2018 \npassed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal [hereafter referred to as “the \nTribunal”].  \n2. Although a perusal of the appeal discloses that three (3) questions are \nproposed on behalf of the appellant/revenue, in substance, they veer ar ound \none (1) issue, which is, whether the reimbursement of advertising, market ing \nand promotion expenses (AMP), incurred by the respondent/asses see on \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 2 of 11 \n behalf of its Associated Enterprise (AE), was at arm‟s length. In other \nwords, whether any upward adjustment was required to be carried ou t in the \namount received by the respondent/assessee from its AE.  \n2.1 The inter-related issue that arose for consideration was wheth er the \nTransfer Pricing Officer (TPO) ought to have used the bright line test (BLT) \nin computing the arm‟ s length price (ALP) concerning AMP activities \ncarried out by the respondent/assessee. \n3. The aforementioned issues arise for consideration against the  \nbackdrop of the following broad facts and circumstances. \n3.1 In and about November 1994, the respondent/assessee was \nincorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation , Japan \n(SCJ). SCJ held shares in the respondent/assessee via its subsidiaries, Sony \nHolding (Asia) B.V., Netherlands, and Sony Gulf FZE, Dubai.  \n3.2 Initially, the respondent/assessee was into manufacturing, ass embling, \nimporting, and distributing various colour televisions, audio recording media \nequipment, information technology products, software, and general au dio \nproducts. \n3.3 However, with effect from 01.07.2004, the respondent/assessee sh ut \ndown its manufacturing activities.   \n3.4 Thereafter, on 01.04.2005, the respondent/assessee entered into an \nadvertisement agreement with Sony Electronics Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.  \n4. The respondent/assessee filed its return of income (ROI), fo r AY \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 3 of 11 \n 2007-08, on 30.10.2007. In the ROI for AY 2007-08, the \nrespondent/assessee declared its income as Rs. 82,58,38,988/-. This  return \nwas processed under Section 143(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 [hereaf ter \nreferred to as “Act”].  \n4.1 The respondent‟s/assessee‟s re turn was, thereafter, picked up for \nscrutiny, and accordingly, notices under Sections 143(2) and 14 2(1) of the \nAct were issued. \n4.2 In the course of assessment proceedings, a reference was made to the \nTPO, under Section 92CA of the Act, for the determination of ALP. \n4.3 The TPO issued a notice, dated 22.09.2010, calling upon t he \nrespondent/assessee to show cause as to why international transact ions \nconcerning reimbursement of advertisement expenses should not b e \nbenchmarked under the provisions of Section 92C of the Act. The t hrust of \nthe show cause notice was that the respondent/assessee, which was primari ly \nengaged in the distribution of imported audio and visual pr oducts in the \nIndian market, was incurring AMP expenses on behalf of its AE.  \n4.4 As per the TPO, although the respondent/assessee had incu rred Rs. \n119,54,43,600/- towards brand promotion and developing m arketing \nintangibles for its AE, it was reimbursed only Rs. 72,63,324/-.   \n4.5 In response to the notice, the respondent/assessee filed a rep ly dated \n11.10.2010.  \n4.6 Ultimately, the TPO passed an order, dated 25.10.2010, whereb y, Rs. \n65,34,38,272/- was added to the taxable income of responden t/assessee, \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 4 of 11 \n having regard to the amount by which AMP expenses incurred by th e \nrespondent/assessee exceeded the amount, as determined by applyin g the \nBLT dicta.  \n5. The Assessing Officer (AO), thus, passed a draft assessment or der in \nline with the adjustment made by the TPO . Against the TPO‟s order, the \nrespondent/assessee preferred objections with the Dispute Resolut ion Panel \n(DRP), which were rejected via order dated 27.09.2011.  \n6. Consequentially, the AO passed a final assessment order o n \n10.10.2011, as per the directions of the DRP.  \n7. The record shows that the respondent/assessee preferred an appeal  to \nthe Tribunal against the directions issued by the DRP. The  Tribunal, vide \norder dated 07.06.2013, remitted the matter to the TPO/AO for \ndetermination of AMP expenses, albeit , after taking into account a proper \ncomparable, and granting a hearing to the authorized representative of the \nrespondent/assessee.  \n8. The record discloses that cross-appeals were preferred to this co urt \nagainst the order of the Tribunal. These appeals were disposed of by a \ncoordinate bench of this court via an order dated 23.07.2018. One of the \nquestions raised in the appeal preferred by the respondent/as sessee \nconcerned AMP expenses. The said question reads as follows:  \n“Whether the advertising and marketing expenditure incurred by the \nappellant/assessee can be treated as international transaction and made \nsubject matter of adjustment in a rm’s length pricing? ” \n8.1 The operative directions, by the coordinate bench, qua the \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 5 of 11 \n aforementioned question are extracted hereafter: \n“3. After hearing the parties we are inclined to set aside the order passed by \nthe Tribunal in view of decision in Sony Ericson Mobile Communication \nIndia Private Limited v. CIT , (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del). \n4.  Accordingly, the question is answered in terms of the decision in Sony \nEricson Mobile Communication (supra)  with an order of remit to the \nTribunal to decide the issue afresh in light of the direction given in the \naforesaid decision. \n5.  We may record that counsel for the assessee has submitted that there have \nbeen subsequent decisions by this Court and other High Courts which the \nassessee would like to rely upon. It is open for assessee to rely upon the \nsaid ratios. Equally, Revenue will be entitled to defend their stand. \n6. Counsel for the Revenue submits as the order of the Tribunal has been set \naside, Revenue would raise all pleas and contentions when the appeals \nare taken up for hearing. It will be open to the Revenue to rely upon \njudgments and ratios which they feel are in their favour. Counsel for the \nassessee states that he would have no objection but would contest the \ncontention of the Revenue on merits. ” \n8.2 Accordingly, the order impugned in the said cross-appeals  was set \naside, and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal for fresh decision , bearing \nin mind the directions contained in Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications \nIndia Pvt. Ltd. v. CIT-III , (2015) 55 taxmann.com 240 (Delhi).  \n9. On remand, the Tribunal allowed the appeal of the \nrespondent/assessee. \n10.  Being aggrieved, the appellant/revenue has preferred the inst ant \nappeal.  \nSubmissions by counsels:  \n11. Arguments on behalf of the appellant/revenue were addressed  by Mr \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 6 of 11 \n Sanjeev Menon, whereas, submissions on behalf of the respondent/a ssessee \nwere advanced by Mr Nageshwar Rao.  \n12. We may note that although an opportunity was granted to both parties \nto file written submissions, the appellant/revenue has not availed of the \nopportunity.  \n13. The submissions advanced by Mr Sanjeev Menon can be, broa dly, \nparaphrased as follows:  \n(i) The „Sony‟ brand is promoted by the respondent/assessee in In dia. \nThe respondent/assessee has incurred huge expenses for the prom otion and \ndevelopment of the brand and has, therefore, created a marketing intan gible \nfor its AE. Therefore, the TPO was right in holding that the effo rt made by \nthe respondent/assessee qua its AE needed to be adequately compensated. \nBecause of the advent of modern technology, brand promotion in I ndia has a \ncross-border impact, and thus, the benefit to the AE is direct and im mediate, \ncontrary to the view held by the Tribunal.  \n(ii) Merely because the TPO accepted other international transactions  by \napplying the transactional net margin method (TNMM), it cannot  be said \nthat the respondent/assessee was not required to be compensated  for \npromoting the brand owned by its AE.  \n(iii) A person/entity at arm‟s  length would expect \nremuneration/compensation commensurate with the effort put in  for \npromoting and marketing the brand of its AE. Therefore, the \nremuneration/compensation paid for such effort should factor in not only the \nentrepreneurial effort but also the cost of funds utilized, a nd the opportunity \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 7 of 11 \n cost involved in incurring such marketing expenses. If regard is h ad to such \naspects, then the markup of 7.01%, applied by the TPO, would appe ar to be \nquite reasonable.  \n(iv) The Tribunal failed to appreciate that the import of „electronic ‟ goods \nwas distinct and independent of AMP activity. The AMP activity  was not \nincidental or in any way, irreversibly bundled with the imp ort of goods. \nThus, the ALP for AMP expenses could have been arrived at by s eparately \nbenchmarking AMP services.  \n(v) The Tribunal erred in accepting comparables selected by the \nrespondent/assessee even when the said comparables had been rejected for \ngood reasons by the TPO.  \n14. Mr Nageshwar Rao, on the other hand, resisted the appeal, bot h \nbecause there was a huge delay in re-filing the appeal and on merits:  \n(i) It was pointed out that the delay in re-filing, which was  423 days, was \nneither bonafide nor unintentional. It was emphasized by Mr Rao that  the \nreasons given in the application for condonation of delay in re-filing were \nvague and insufficient.  \n(ii) On merits, it was submitted that from the list of int ernational \ntransactions extracted by the TPO, the single largest transact ion for the \nimport of goods amounted to Rs. 1445 crores. It was stated that these goods \nwere sold in India for a gross value of Rs. 2340 crores, resulting in a net \nmargin of 3.29% after adjusting AMP expenses, amounting to Rs. \n119,54,43,600/-. As compared to the net margin earned by the \nrespondent/assessee, the comparable companies/entities selected by  the \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 8 of 11 \n TPO, during the same period, earned a margin of 2.09%. \n(iii) The TPO had rejected the respondent‟s/assess ee‟s contention that he \nought to adopt the aggregated benchmark analysis. The TPO, in stead, \napplied the BLT to determine ALP, contrary to the judgment of th is court \nrendered in the Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India case.   \n(iv) The TPO‟s findings are contradictory in as much as, on the one hand, \nhe notes that the money expended on AMP has resulted in increasin g the \nsales of the respondent/assessee in India, while on the other, he concludes \nthat the increase in sales has benefited the AE. The TPO, contrary to \nbusiness realities, observed that the high AMP spend had result ed in \nlowering the respondent‟s/ assessee‟s  profitability.  \n(v) Erroneously, the TPO rejected the respondent ‟s/assessee‟s contention \nthat the better net margin earned by it, as compared to the companies/e ntities \nselected by the TPO for employing the BLT tool, only demonstrate d that the \ndistribution business satisfied the ALP test.  \n(vi) The DRP committed the same error as the TPO in approving t he \nemployment of the BLT tool, in the determination of ALP. This erro r was \ncompounded as the DRP summarily rejected the respondent‟s/assess ee‟s \nassertion that the AMP expenses already stood covered in the comp ensation \nmodel agreed to between itself and its AE. Given the findings o f fact \nreturned by the Tribunal and the position of law, as enunciated b y the court \nin the Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications case, no interference was \ncalled for with the impugned order.  \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:14.12.2023\n17:23:24Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.7/2023                                                                                                  Page 9 of 11 \n Reasons and Analysis:  \n15. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, and exam ined the \nrecord, the only issue, as noted at the outset, which arise s for consideration, \nis whether the respondent/assessee was adequately compensated  for \nexpenses incurred for AMP activities carried out in India.  \n16. Before one answers the issue, one way or the other, one must bear in \nmind the following undisputed facts which obtain in the instant case:  \n(i) First, the respondent/assessee had shut down its manufactu ring \nactivity in India with effect from 01.07.2004.  \n(ii) Second, in the period in issue, i.e., FY 2006-07 (AY 2007-08 ), there \nwas no advertising agreement obtaining between the respondent/a ssessee \nand its AE. The last agreement was entered into on 01.04.2005, wh ich \napparently, had come to an end.  \n(iii) Third, the TPO had used comparables furnished by the \nrespondent/assessee for employing the BLT tool, in ascertaining the ALP \nqua AMP activities.  \n(iv) Fourth, concededly, the respondent ‟",

The appeals concern the assessment years 2012-13 and 2013-14. The Tribunal had adopted the TNMM for determining the ALP of international transactions concerning indenting transactions entered into by the respondent/assessee with its AEs.

On 30.01.2023, we had heard the matter at some length, when we had \netched out the broad controversy that arose between the parties. For the sak e \nof convenience the said order is extracted hereafter: \n“1. These appeals impugn a common order dated 21.05.2019 passed \nby the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal [in short, “Tribunal”].  \n2. ITA No.22/2023 concerns Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14, while \nITA No.23/2023 concerns AY 2012-13.  \n3. According to Mr Vipul Agarwal, who appears on behalf of the \nappellant/revenue, the impugned order passed by the Tribunal was \nreceived by the appellant/revenue on 06.06.2019.  \n3.1 We may note that the affidavits accompanying the appeals indicate \nthat they were sworn on 17.08.2020. Prima facie, there is delay in \nfiling the appeals as well.  \n3.2. The above-captioned applications [i.e., CM Nos.1876/2023 \n& 1880/2023], though, seek condonation of delay, only in re-filing the \nappeals.  \n3.3. Interestingly, the re-filling applications are also dated \n17.08.2020 and are accompanied by an affidavit which has been \nsworn on the same date. \n4. According to us, there is complete lack of clarity on the part of the \nappellant/revenue, as to whether they are seeking condonation of \ndelay in filing the appeals or re-filing the appeals.  \n5.     That being said, there is a considerable delay, even if one were to \ntake into account the fact that Covid-19 had kicked in. Insofar as this \ncourt was concerned, there was disruption in work in and about \nMarch 2020 and thereafter.  \n6. Mr C.S. Aggarwal, learned senior counsel, who appears on behalf \nof the respondent/assessee, points out that the applications for \ncondonation of delay in re-filing were filed only on 07.01.2023, \nalthough, as noticed above, they are dated 17.08.2020. \n6.1 Mr C.S. Aggarwal also asserts that the defects pointed out by the \nRegistry have not been cured.  \n7.  Insofar as the merits of the case are concerned, the controversy \nwhich arises concerns the commission earned by the \nrespondent/assessee, with respect to certain international transactions \nthat it entered into with its Associated Enterprises [hereafter referred \nto as “AEs”]. These transactions are, broadly, referred to as \n“indenting transactions”.  \n8. We may note, and qua which there is no dispute, disputes \nconcerning AYs 2007-08 to 2010-11, had reached this court.  \n8.1.   This court via judgment dated 22.07.2016 had remitted the \nsubject appeals to the Tribunal. Via the very same judgment, the  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 3 of 11 \n coordinate bench of this court had given leeway to the Tribunal to \nremand the matter to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO)/Assessing \nOfficer (AO) for fresh examination of the issues relating to transfer \npricing, albeit in accordance with the law. \n8.2. The said judgment rendered by the coordinate bench was \npassed in the following appeals: \n             “ITA Nos.381/2013, 738/2015, 382/2013 & 702/2014.”  \n9. Mr C.S. Aggarwal, in support of submission has placed \nbefore us a hard copy of the order dated 22.10.2018 passed by \nthe Tribunal, upon remand by the coordinate bench of this \ncourt.  \n10. We have been taken by Mr C.S. Aggarwal through the order \npassed by the Tribunal. Briefly put, the Tribunal has returned \nthe following two significant findings of fact:  \n10.1 First, the Transaction Net Margin Method (TNMM) \nwould be the  \nmost suitable method for determining Arm‟s Length Price (ALP) \nfor international transactions concerning indenting transactions \nentered into by the respondent/assessee with its AEs. \n10.2 Second, the Berry ratio method for calculating Profit \nLevel Indicator (PLI) would be most appropriate insofar as the \nrespondent/assessee is concerned.  \n11. In respect of the aforesaid findings of fact, a detailed \nanalysis has been made by the Tribunal in paragraphs 15 to 19 \nof its order dated 22.10.2018. For the sake of convenience, the \nrelevant paragraphs are extracted hereafter: \n \n“15. We have heard the parties at length and also \nperused the material referred to before us as \ndiscussed herein above. The approach of \ndetermining the ALP on the basis of average percent \nof commission reported by the assessee in respect of \nindenting transactions with the non AEs as held by \nthe Tribunal has not found judicial favour with the \nHon'ble High Court and matter has been remanded \nback for further examination of similarity between \nthe two transactions and to conduct further in depth \ninquiry to examine the high degree of comparability \nof relevant control and uncontrolled transactions. \nFurther, if the average rate of commission on such \ntransactions was to be applied to the FOB value of \ngoods involved in the indenting transactions with the \nAEs, then this Tribunal has to satisfy itself that there \nis no significant variation in the rate of commission \nbetween different products. From the perusal of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 4 of 11 \n indenting transactions undertaken by the assessee \nwith AE and non AE under various product \nsegments, it is discerned that, for instance in the \nproduct segment „Automotive‟, the assessee has \nundertaken 249 transactions with AE and only 4 \nwith non AE and in the Assessment Year 2007-08 the \nvolume of transaction, FOB value wise is „Nil‟ in the \ncase of non AE; and the commission earned with the \nAE is Rs. 7,50,43,686/- and with the non AE it is \nonly Rs. 9,672/-. Similarly the products dealt with \nAE in automotive segment are entirely different and \nthe geographies involved are Switzerland, \nSingapore, Thailand and Japan whereas non AE \ntransactions  are with Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt. \nLtd. and Bajaj Auto Ltd in India. Likewise under the \nproduct „chemicals‟ the assessee has undertaken \n1044 transaction with AE and only 112 transaction \nwith non AE and the commission with AE is 1.28%, \nwhereas non AE it is 2.26%. Similarly, the products \ndealt with AE and non AE under this segment are \nquite different and geography involved with AE are \nSpain, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Thailand, whereas \nwith non AE it is India. Likewise in „electronics‟ \nsegment the  transaction undertaken with the AE are \n253, whereas with the non AE it is 5 and again not \nonly the products are different but also geographical \nlocation are different with that of non-AE which are \nmostly with Indian parties and all AE transactions \nare with various foreign countries. Similar \ndifferences are noted in all across 10 to 11 products \ndealt by the assessee with AEs and non AEs. The \ntotal number of transactions with the AE during the \nyear was 3,145 and with non AE it was only 371. \nThus, apparently there is a huge difference in \nvolume on FOB basis and the geographies dealt are \nalso entirely different. The amount of average \ncommission earned with the AE, is 1.58% whereas \nin the case of non AE it is 2.26. All these differences \nare permeating in all the Assessment Years as \nhighlighted by the assessee in the chart submitted \nbefore us and on perusal of the same, it is quite \nglaring that under both the transactions, i.e., \ncontrolled transaction with the AE and uncontrolled \ntransaction with the non AEs, there are huge \ndissimilarity between the products, difference in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 5 of 11 \n volume, difference in value, markets and \ngeographical location. \n16. It is quite settled proposition that while \napplying CUP method, a very high degree of \nsimilarity has to be seen between the control and \nuncontrolled transactions not only in terms of \nproducts, contractual terms, volume, value but also \nmarket and geography locations. The reason being \nunder CUP, price charged or paid for the property \ntransferred has to be identified and the differences \nbetween the international transaction and the \ncomparable uncontrolled transactions has to be \nseen which could materially affect the price in the \nopen market. The price of different products \ncannot be the same as it depends upon the \nnegotiation based on volumes, value and other \ncontractual terms. Further different market and \ngeographical location also affects the pricing \nfactors and therefore, if there are differences on \naccount of these factors CUP cannot be held to be \nthe most appropriate method for bench marking \nthe arm's length price. Here in this case, under the \nindenting segment there are various dissimilarities \nin the transaction with the AE and non AE as \ndiscussed above and for this reason alone the \naverage commission earned cannot be the \nbenchmarking factor for determining the ALP, and \ntherefore, we hold that neither the CUP method \ncan be applied nor the transaction with the AE and \nnon AE can be taken for the purpose of \ncomparability analysis. Thus, we reject the CUP \nmethod by taking the average commission earned \nin the transaction with the AE and non AE.  \n \n17. Now, in these circumstances, we have to see \nwhether TNMM can be considered as most \nappropriate method. First of all, it has been \nbrought on record before us that right from the \nAssessment Years 2003-04 to 2006-07, TNMM has \nbeen accepted as the most appropriate method by \nthe TPO. However, instead of ‘berry ratio’ as PLI, \nTPO has taken OP/TC as PLI. Further, it has been \nbrought to our notice that from the Assessment \nYears 2011-12 to 2018-19 under the MAP \nagreement it has been agreed that TNMM should \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 6 of 11 \n be the most appropriate method to determine the \nALP of the international transaction of the indent \nkeeping into the fact that assessee is a low risk \nservice provider and there is no change in FAR \nright from Assessment Years 2003-04 to 2018-19. \nOnce TNMM has been accepted under the similar \nFAR, we do not find any reason to deviate by \nadopting some other method. Otherwise also we \nhave held that CUP method cannot be applied and \nother methods admittedly are incapable of \ncapturing the true arm's length result and \ntherefore, we hold that TNMM should be taken as \na most appropriate method for benchmarking the \nsaid transaction.  \n \n18. Now having accepted that TNMM is the most \nappropriate method, the second issue which needs to \nbe clarified is what should be the base for computing \nthe PLI. As stated above, the Hon'ble High Court \nhas approved the permissibility of using all „berry \nratio‟ as PLI in a situation where the functions \nperformed did not entail huge creation of valuable \nintangibles. The nature of the assessee's business is \na routine business support services and there is no \ncreation of any human capital or supply chain \nintangible.  The Hon'ble High Court has held that \n‘berry ratio’ can  only be applied where the value of \ngoods is not directly linked to the quantum of \nprofits and the profits are mainly determined on \nexpenses incurred. Here in this case, the assessee is \nacting as an indenting agent commission service \nprovider, i.e., as a facilitator of a trade and has no \nfinancial risk, because assessee was not required to \nraise any invoice for sale and purchase in its \nfinancial commitment and risk are insignificant. \nAs a service provider, the key business driver for \nthe assessee is operating expenses incurred on  \nestablishment and operation of business, i.e., \nsalary, rent and other such expenses and it does \nnot employ any significant assets in the business \nexcept for routine assets like office, furniture and \nfixtures to run its business and also there is no \nintangible creation by the assessee company. \nBesides there is no trading capital employed as \ngoods are neither bought nor sold by the assessee \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 7 of 11 \n in the indenting segment. Under these facts and \ncircumstances, the profit derived by the assessee is \nmainly depended on its operating expenditure as \nthe value of goods does not enter in its financial. \nAs a low risk service provider, it seeks to obtain \nadequate return on its  operating expenses as the \noperating expenses incurred represents the value \nadded carried on by the assessee. In other  words, \nthe operating expenses adequately and sufficiently \nrepresents the functions performed and the risk \nundertaken by the assessee . Thus, we hold that the \n‘berry ratio’ should be accepted as the most \nappropriate PLI for taking as base under TNMM  \nwhile determining the ALP of the Indian \ntransaction for all the five years under appeal.  \n19. Accordingly, we remand the matter back to the \nfile of the TPO to examine and benchmark the \ninternational transaction by adopting TNMM as \nthe most appropriate method by taking ‘berry ratio’ \nas PLI . The assessee has to substantiate its margin \nby bringing comparable uncontrolled transactions \nto demonstrate that its commission earned in this \nsegment is at arm's length; and the TPO shall \nexamine the same and decide accordingly. Needless \nto say that TPO shall give due and effective \nopportunity to the assessee to substantiate its ALP \nas per direction given above. ” \n[Emphasis is ours] \n \n11.1. In the instant matter, the Tribunal, via order dated \n21.05.2019 concluded as follows, having regard to the para \nmateria circumstances which obtained when the order dated \n22.10.2018 was passed: \n“5.

The main allegation against the respondent/assessee is, t hat it has \nintroduced unaccounted income in its books in the guise of “bogus Long \nTerm Capital Gains ” [“LTCG”].  \n3.1 The LTCG, as per the Assessment Order dated 31.03.2015, which \nwere registered by the respondent/assessee in each of the AYs is t he \nfollowing: \n Assessment Year \n(AY) Amount \n1. 2008-09 Rs. 37,41,74,914/- \n2. 2009-10 Rs. 2,29,30,711/- \n3. 2010-11 Rs. 59,24,97,150/- \n4. In order to adjudicate upon the appeals, the following bro ad facts are \nrequired to be noticed: \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:21.01.2023\n20:50:57Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023/DHC/000461 \n \nITA 13/2023 & connected appeals                                                                                             Page 3 of 9 \n 4.1 On 07.08.2012, a survey was carried out by the appellant/ revenue in \nexercise of powers under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [in  \nshort, “the Act”], and  according to the appellant/revenue, during \ninvestigation, the aforementioned fact was revealed i.e., that t he \nrespondent/assessee had introduced unaccounted income in its b ooks of \naccounts in the guise of LTCG to the extent indicated hereinab ove, albeit , \nby first investing and then selling the shares of two entitie s i.e., REI Agro \nLtd. [in short, “REI”] and REI Six Ten Ltd. [in short, “REI Six”].  \n5. The respondent/assessee, against the LTCG, had claimed exempt ion \nfrom tax. \n6. It is not in dispute, that REI is a listed company, and its shares were \ntransacted on the stock exchange. \n7. The facts also show, that during the course of the survey on \n07.08.2012, the statement of one Mr Brij Mohan Vyas was recorded. \n7.1 Mr Brij Mohan Vyas, according to the appellant/revenue, is an  \nemployee of REI Agro Group.  \n8. It has also emerged, that the respondent/assessee is in the bu siness of \ntrading and investing in scrips. The shares of REI were bought and  sold \nthrough brokers, on instructions of one Mr Sandeep Kumar Jhunjunwala. \n9. We may also note, that Mr Brij Mohan Vyas, in his statement, ha d \nindicated that he was working in Octal Suppliers Pvt. Ltd, and used to buy \nand sell shares on instructions of Mr Sandeep Kumar Jhunjunwala. \n10. The Assessing Officer has relied upon the details gath ered by the \nInvestigation Wing, to conclude that the respondent/assesse e had introduced \nits unaccounted income to purchase and sell shares of REI. These det ails are \nset forth in the form of a flow chart in paragraph 5 of the Assessment  Order \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:21.01.2023\n20:50:57Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023/DHC/000461 \n \nITA 13/2023 & connected appeals                                                                                             Page 4 of 9 \n in ITA 14/2023.  For the sake of convenience, the said chart is s et forth \nhereafter: \n \n \n11. Thus, based on the information gathered by the Investigat ion Wing, \nthe Assessing Officer concluded, that the entire set of transact ions was a \n‘sham’, and  that the same had been configured to give the sale and purchase \nof shares by the respondent/assessee a legal framework. \n12. It is important to note, that the Assessment Order was passed pursuan t \nto reopening of assessment of the respondent/assessee under Secti on 148 of \nthe Act. \n13. Being aggrieved , the respondent/assessee carried the matter in appeal \nto the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [in short, “CIT(A)”].  \n14. The CIT(A) via order dated 29.06.2016 partly allowed the \nrespondent/assesee’s appeals.  \n15. This time around, the appellant/revenue was aggrieved, an d hence, an \nappeal was preferred to the Tribunal. \n16. The Tribunal considered the matter in great detail, and exami ned, as it \nappears from the record, various facets put forth before it, including t he \ninformation as regards the fund flow gathered by the Investi gation Wing, \nwhich was adverted to inter alia  in paragraph 5 of the order passed by the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:21.01.2023\n20:50:57Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023/DHC/000461 \n \nITA 13/2023 & connected appeals                                                                                             Page 5 of 9 \n Assessing Officer. The Tribunal, however, came to the conclusion th at the \norder passed by the CIT(A) had to be confirmed. For the sake of \nconvenience, the relevant observations made by the Tribunal are hereafte r: \n“14. We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant findings \ngiven in the impugned order as well as material referred to before us. It is \nan undisputed fact that assessee-firm is engaged in the business of trading \nin shares and also made investment in shares from where assessee had \nshown huge business income and also shown capital gain. One of the facts \nnoted by the Assessing Officer in the assessment order is that during the \nAssessment Year 2008-09 assessee has declared profit from trading in \nshares of REI Agro Ltd. and also during the year assessee has transferred \nopening stock and purchased shares of REI Agro India under investment \nportfolio. The assessee had shown separate ledger account in respect of \npurchases made under investment account of Rs. 13,38,77,337/- and had \nalso shown purchases of Rs.27,84,14,870/- under stock-in-trade for trading \npurpose from which assessee has declared income of Rs. 16,66,59,460/- and \nstock (investment) has been disclosed at Rs. 13,38,77,338/-. Now, in so far \nas trading of shares is concerned, no adverse inference has been drawn by \nthe Assessing Officer. \n \n15. The assessee's case has been reopened u/s.147 on the basis of some \ninformation received from Investigation Wing that the assessee has \ngenerated some bogus Long Term Capital Gain in collusion with M/s. REI \nAgro Ltd. However, no such evidence or material has been brought on \nrecord nor there is any report with regard to nature of collusion implicating \nthe assessee that it was involved in any of such collusion with M/s. REI Agro \nLtd. for generating bogus Long Term Capital Gain. Strong reliance has \nbeen made by the Assessing Officer with regard to the statement of Shri Brij \nMohan Vyas, an employee of REI Agro Group during the survey carried out \non 07.08.2012 on REI Agro Ltd. The relevant extract of the statement has \nalready been incorporated above. From plain reading of the statement, \nnowhere it is borne out that whether the company was into manipulating of \nshare prices in the stock exchange. He only refers to how one, Sandeep \nKumar Jhunjunwala has asked to buy the shares of M/s. REI Agro and what \nis the right time to buy and sell the shares of such company. One highlighted \nportion by the Assessing Officer on which adverse inference has been drawn \nis that the companies have issued right issues at Rs.19.50/- and now the rate \nis down so we are increasing our stake and we are controlling and driving \nthe shares to maintain the rates for the interest of shareholders This \nstatement only refers that the company tries to see that the share price does \nnot fall in the interest of the shareholders, nowhere it has been said that the \ncompany was involved in rigging the price in the stock exchange. Another \nfact the Assessing Officer had noted and has drawn adverse inference is that \nassessee had made transaction of shores of some of the Gujarat based \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:21.01.2023\n20:50:57Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023/DHC/000461 \n \nITA 13/2023 & connected appeals                                                                                             Page 6 of 9 \n companies, who in their balance sheet have shown losses on account \ntrading of share of this company. He is trying to demonstrate that how funds \nwere flowing from REI Agro Group on account of unsecured loans to \nvarious 6 companies who have purchased shares from the assessee and \nthereafter purely on hypothetical presumption and without any material on \nrecord, he has assumed that cash must have been given to REI Group Agro. \nHow the entire fund flow chart has been linked with assessee to adverse \ninference is not clear. If REI Agro Group has funded certain companies \nthrough loan and if these six companies have purchased shares from the \nassessee and then have suffered losses, then how it can be inferred that \nthere was some kind of collusion of assessee. First of all, it is not clear that \nthese companies have incurred losses merely on trading of shares of REI \nAgro Group; and secondly, if the entire transaction is through National \nStock Exchange had traded on quoted market price, then how it can be \ninferred that the Long Term Capital Gain claimed by assessee was on \naccount of dumping of losses in the books of some Gujarat based \ncompanies. There has to be some material or inquiry wherein assessee has \nbeen found to be involved directly or indirectly either in rigging of price of \nREI Agro Group or was some kind of collusion for such accommodation \nentries. \n \n16. One another angle which can be seen is that, nowhere the Assessing \nOfficer has stated that the stares of the REI Agro Group have jumped \nastronomically within a short period; or REI Group has been black listed \neither by the SEBI or by the Stock Exchange for any kind of price \nmanipulation or any kind of action has been taken. The Assessing Officer \nhas not even brought on record that REI Agro had no substantial financial \nworth which can justify the share price. The shares of REI Agro Ltd. is a \nfreely traded share in stock exchange where the millions are trading in \nthese shares regularly as brought out by the ld. counsel at the time of \nhearing. When assessee has purchased these shares for the trading purpose \nin the earlier years, which has been accepted by the Department; and if part \nof the same scrip has been converted into investment and sold during the \nyear, then can it be held that part of the transaction is a bogus transaction \nno as to invoke deeming fiction of Section 68. The purchases of shares have \nnot been doubted by the Assessing Officer, as he has taxed only the net \ncapital gain. If these shares were reflected in the books of account of the \nearlier years acquired as stock-in-trade, which has been sold through stock \nexchange after paying STT and the money has been received through \nbanking channels, then how it can be inferred that shares were purchased \nand sold by way of some bogus entry. If the credits in the bank account and \nin the books are from sale of an asset or stock then same cannot be added \nu/s.68. The entire premise at the Assessing Officer is based on some \ninvestigation report wherein there is only presumption drawn that, since \nsome Gujarat Company have purchased the shares who have incurred \nlosses and were being funded through various routes on account of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:21.01.2023\n20:50:57Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NUMBER: 2023/DHC/000461 \n \nITA 13/2023 & connected appeals                                                                                             Page 7 of 9 \n unsecured loan, therefore there must be some collusion. But such a report \ndoes not lead to any kind of inference against the assessee that the assessee \nwas involved in either of these chains of companies to route any \nunaccounted money. It is not a case here where there is one instance of sale \nand purchase of particular share which has been sold during the year, but \nhere it is a case where assessee is a trader in shares who has dealt in \nseveral scrips and even showing business income from such trading of \nshares and also dealing in investment of shares. \n \n17. In one of the statement of Shri Manoj Singh Jadoun which has been \nrecorded by the investigation wing, as incorporated in the assessment order, \nit is seen that a specific question was asked vide question no.20 as to why \nand what was the reason for purchase of share of REI Agro Ltd. on a very \nhigher price and secondly on suffering of losses by a group of companies. \nThe said question and reply reads as under: \n \nQ.20 What was the reason of purchase of shares of REI Agro Ltd at \nvery high prices and consequently suffering losses by your group \ncompanies? \n Ans. Sir, these companies have made investment in the shares of \nREI Agro Ltd with the intention to earn profit and the same was \npurely a business decision and on the basis of study of the share \nmarket. However, sometimes we had taken advice from director of \nM/s. Tripti Merchants Pvt. Ltd regarding investment to be made in \nshares.

On 30.01.2023, we had heard the matter at some length, when we had \netched out the broad controversy that arose between the parties. For the sak e \nof convenience the said order is extracted hereafter: \n“1. These appeals impugn a common order dated 21.05.2019 passed \nby the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal [in short, “Tribunal”].  \n2. ITA No.22/2023 concerns Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14, while \nITA No.23/2023 concerns AY 2012-13.  \n3. According to Mr Vipul Agarwal, who appears on behalf of the \nappellant/revenue, the impugned order passed by the Tribunal was \nreceived by the appellant/revenue on 06.06.2019.  \n3.1 We may note that the affidavits accompanying the appeals indicate \nthat they were sworn on 17.08.2020. Prima facie, there is delay in \nfiling the appeals as well.  \n3.2. The above-captioned applications [i.e., CM Nos.1876/2023 \n& 1880/2023], though, seek condonation of delay, only in re-filing the \nappeals.  \n3.3. Interestingly, the re-filling applications are also dated \n17.08.2020 and are accompanied by an affidavit which has been \nsworn on the same date. \n4. According to us, there is complete lack of clarity on the part of the \nappellant/revenue, as to whether they are seeking condonation of \ndelay in filing the appeals or re-filing the appeals.  \n5.     That being said, there is a considerable delay, even if one were to \ntake into account the fact that Covid-19 had kicked in. Insofar as this \ncourt was concerned, there was disruption in work in and about \nMarch 2020 and thereafter.  \n6. Mr C.S. Aggarwal, learned senior counsel, who appears on behalf \nof the respondent/assessee, points out that the applications for \ncondonation of delay in re-filing were filed only on 07.01.2023, \nalthough, as noticed above, they are dated 17.08.2020. \n6.1 Mr C.S. Aggarwal also asserts that the defects pointed out by the \nRegistry have not been cured.  \n7.  Insofar as the merits of the case are concerned, the controversy \nwhich arises concerns the commission earned by the \nrespondent/assessee, with respect to certain international transactions \nthat it entered into with its Associated Enterprises [hereafter referred \nto as “AEs”]. These transactions are, broadly, referred to as \n“indenting transactions”.  \n8. We may note, and qua which there is no dispute, disputes \nconcerning AYs 2007-08 to 2010-11, had reached this court.  \n8.1.   This court via judgment dated 22.07.2016 had remitted the \nsubject appeals to the Tribunal. Via the very same judgment, the  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 3 of 11 \n coordinate bench of this court had given leeway to the Tribunal to \nremand the matter to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO)/Assessing \nOfficer (AO) for fresh examination of the issues relating to transfer \npricing, albeit in accordance with the law. \n8.2. The said judgment rendered by the coordinate bench was \npassed in the following appeals: \n             “ITA Nos.381/2013, 738/2015, 382/2013 & 702/2014.”  \n9. Mr C.S. Aggarwal, in support of submission has placed \nbefore us a hard copy of the order dated 22.10.2018 passed by \nthe Tribunal, upon remand by the coordinate bench of this \ncourt.  \n10. We have been taken by Mr C.S. Aggarwal through the order \npassed by the Tribunal. Briefly put, the Tribunal has returned \nthe following two significant findings of fact:  \n10.1 First, the Transaction Net Margin Method (TNMM) \nwould be the  \nmost suitable method for determining Arm‟s Length Price (ALP) \nfor international transactions concerning indenting transactions \nentered into by the respondent/assessee with its AEs. \n10.2 Second, the Berry ratio method for calculating Profit \nLevel Indicator (PLI) would be most appropriate insofar as the \nrespondent/assessee is concerned.  \n11. In respect of the aforesaid findings of fact, a detailed \nanalysis has been made by the Tribunal in paragraphs 15 to 19 \nof its order dated 22.10.2018. For the sake of convenience, the \nrelevant paragraphs are extracted hereafter: \n \n“15. We have heard the parties at length and also \nperused the material referred to before us as \ndiscussed herein above. The approach of \ndetermining the ALP on the basis of average percent \nof commission reported by the assessee in respect of \nindenting transactions with the non AEs as held by \nthe Tribunal has not found judicial favour with the \nHon'ble High Court and matter has been remanded \nback for further examination of similarity between \nthe two transactions and to conduct further in depth \ninquiry to examine the high degree of comparability \nof relevant control and uncontrolled transactions. \nFurther, if the average rate of commission on such \ntransactions was to be applied to the FOB value of \ngoods involved in the indenting transactions with the \nAEs, then this Tribunal has to satisfy itself that there \nis no significant variation in the rate of commission \nbetween different products. From the perusal of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 4 of 11 \n indenting transactions undertaken by the assessee \nwith AE and non AE under various product \nsegments, it is discerned that, for instance in the \nproduct segment „Automotive‟, the assessee has \nundertaken 249 transactions with AE and only 4 \nwith non AE and in the Assessment Year 2007-08 the \nvolume of transaction, FOB value wise is „Nil‟ in the \ncase of non AE; and the commission earned with the \nAE is Rs. 7,50,43,686/- and with the non AE it is \nonly Rs. 9,672/-. Similarly the products dealt with \nAE in automotive segment are entirely different and \nthe geographies involved are Switzerland, \nSingapore, Thailand and Japan whereas non AE \ntransactions  are with Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt. \nLtd. and Bajaj Auto Ltd in India. Likewise under the \nproduct „chemicals‟ the assessee has undertaken \n1044 transaction with AE and only 112 transaction \nwith non AE and the commission with AE is 1.28%, \nwhereas non AE it is 2.26%. Similarly, the products \ndealt with AE and non AE under this segment are \nquite different and geography involved with AE are \nSpain, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Thailand, whereas \nwith non AE it is India. Likewise in „electronics‟ \nsegment the  transaction undertaken with the AE are \n253, whereas with the non AE it is 5 and again not \nonly the products are different but also geographical \nlocation are different with that of non-AE which are \nmostly with Indian parties and all AE transactions \nare with various foreign countries. Similar \ndifferences are noted in all across 10 to 11 products \ndealt by the assessee with AEs and non AEs. The \ntotal number of transactions with the AE during the \nyear was 3,145 and with non AE it was only 371. \nThus, apparently there is a huge difference in \nvolume on FOB basis and the geographies dealt are \nalso entirely different. The amount of average \ncommission earned with the AE, is 1.58% whereas \nin the case of non AE it is 2.26. All these differences \nare permeating in all the Assessment Years as \nhighlighted by the assessee in the chart submitted \nbefore us and on perusal of the same, it is quite \nglaring that under both the transactions, i.e., \ncontrolled transaction with the AE and uncontrolled \ntransaction with the non AEs, there are huge \ndissimilarity between the products, difference in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 5 of 11 \n volume, difference in value, markets and \ngeographical location. \n16. It is quite settled proposition that while \napplying CUP method, a very high degree of \nsimilarity has to be seen between the control and \nuncontrolled transactions not only in terms of \nproducts, contractual terms, volume, value but also \nmarket and geography locations. The reason being \nunder CUP, price charged or paid for the property \ntransferred has to be identified and the differences \nbetween the international transaction and the \ncomparable uncontrolled transactions has to be \nseen which could materially affect the price in the \nopen market. The price of different products \ncannot be the same as it depends upon the \nnegotiation based on volumes, value and other \ncontractual terms. Further different market and \ngeographical location also affects the pricing \nfactors and therefore, if there are differences on \naccount of these factors CUP cannot be held to be \nthe most appropriate method for bench marking \nthe arm's length price. Here in this case, under the \nindenting segment there are various dissimilarities \nin the transaction with the AE and non AE as \ndiscussed above and for this reason alone the \naverage commission earned cannot be the \nbenchmarking factor for determining the ALP, and \ntherefore, we hold that neither the CUP method \ncan be applied nor the transaction with the AE and \nnon AE can be taken for the purpose of \ncomparability analysis. Thus, we reject the CUP \nmethod by taking the average commission earned \nin the transaction with the AE and non AE.  \n \n17. Now, in these circumstances, we have to see \nwhether TNMM can be considered as most \nappropriate method. First of all, it has been \nbrought on record before us that right from the \nAssessment Years 2003-04 to 2006-07, TNMM has \nbeen accepted as the most appropriate method by \nthe TPO. However, instead of ‘berry ratio’ as PLI, \nTPO has taken OP/TC as PLI. Further, it has been \nbrought to our notice that from the Assessment \nYears 2011-12 to 2018-19 under the MAP \nagreement it has been agreed that TNMM should \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 6 of 11 \n be the most appropriate method to determine the \nALP of the international transaction of the indent \nkeeping into the fact that assessee is a low risk \nservice provider and there is no change in FAR \nright from Assessment Years 2003-04 to 2018-19. \nOnce TNMM has been accepted under the similar \nFAR, we do not find any reason to deviate by \nadopting some other method. Otherwise also we \nhave held that CUP method cannot be applied and \nother methods admittedly are incapable of \ncapturing the true arm's length result and \ntherefore, we hold that TNMM should be taken as \na most appropriate method for benchmarking the \nsaid transaction.  \n \n18. Now having accepted that TNMM is the most \nappropriate method, the second issue which needs to \nbe clarified is what should be the base for computing \nthe PLI. As stated above, the Hon'ble High Court \nhas approved the permissibility of using all „berry \nratio‟ as PLI in a situation where the functions \nperformed did not entail huge creation of valuable \nintangibles. The nature of the assessee's business is \na routine business support services and there is no \ncreation of any human capital or supply chain \nintangible.  The Hon'ble High Court has held that \n‘berry ratio’ can  only be applied where the value of \ngoods is not directly linked to the quantum of \nprofits and the profits are mainly determined on \nexpenses incurred. Here in this case, the assessee is \nacting as an indenting agent commission service \nprovider, i.e., as a facilitator of a trade and has no \nfinancial risk, because assessee was not required to \nraise any invoice for sale and purchase in its \nfinancial commitment and risk are insignificant. \nAs a service provider, the key business driver for \nthe assessee is operating expenses incurred on  \nestablishment and operation of business, i.e., \nsalary, rent and other such expenses and it does \nnot employ any significant assets in the business \nexcept for routine assets like office, furniture and \nfixtures to run its business and also there is no \nintangible creation by the assessee company. \nBesides there is no trading capital employed as \ngoods are neither bought nor sold by the assessee \nDigitally Signed\nBy:NEELAM SHARMA\nSigning Date:18.07.2023\n12:43:43Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 22/2023 & ITA 23/2023       Page 7 of 11 \n in the indenting segment. Under these facts and \ncircumstances, the profit derived by the assessee is \nmainly depended on its operating expenditure as \nthe value of goods does not enter in its financial. \nAs a low risk service provider, it seeks to obtain \nadequate return on its  operating expenses as the \noperating expenses incurred represents the value \nadded carried on by the assessee. In other  words, \nthe operating expenses adequately and sufficiently \nrepresents the functions performed and the risk \nundertaken by the assessee . Thus, we hold that the \n‘berry ratio’ should be accepted as the most \nappropriate PLI for taking as base under TNMM  \nwhile determining the ALP of the Indian \ntransaction for all the five years under appeal.  \n19. Accordingly, we remand the matter back to the \nfile of the TPO to examine and benchmark the \ninternational transaction by adopting TNMM as \nthe most appropriate method by taking ‘berry ratio’ \nas PLI . The assessee has to substantiate its margin \nby bringing comparable uncontrolled transactions \nto demonstrate that its commission earned in this \nsegment is at arm's length; and the TPO shall \nexamine the same and decide accordingly. Needless \nto say that TPO shall give due and effective \nopportunity to the assessee to substantiate its ALP \nas per direction given above. ” \n[Emphasis is ours] \n \n11.1. In the instant matter, the Tribunal, via order dated \n21.05.2019 concluded as follows, having regard to the para \nmateria circumstances which obtained when the order dated \n22.10.2018 was passed: \n“5.

JUSTICE RAJNISH BHATNAGAR \n \nRAJNISH BHATNAGAR, J (ORAL)  \n1. The present application is filed under Section 438 of Cod e of \nCriminal Procedure, 1973, seeking anticipatory bail in FIR \nNo.740/2022 dated 19.10.2022, under Section 376/506 of Indian Pen al \nCode, 1860, registered at Police Station Samaipur Badli.  \n2. In brief, the facts of the case are that on 11.10.2022, a PCR call \nwas received regarding quarrel at Gate No.4, Raja Vihar, Samaipur \nBadli, and the contents of PCR call were that “Ek Ladka Ghar par \naakar jhagda kar raha hai” .  The call was initially marked to Head \nConstable for further necessary action.

On receiving this call, IO reached at the address of the \ncomplainant ‘S’ and she stated that her brother -in-law (jeth) had \nquarrelled and misbehaved with her. Thereafter, complainant was se nt \nto BSA for medical examination and her MLC was prepared wherein \nthe treating doctor mentioned the alleged history. It was all eged that \non 11.10.2022 at 11.PM the victim was at her home in Samaip ur Badli \nand was making her bed when suddenly, 4-5 people entered the hou se \nas the door was unlocked and her other family members were upst airs.  \nOut of these 4-5 men, one man namely, Shamsher (petitioner herein)  \ngrabbed breast of the victim, ke pt his legs over victim’s thigh  and \naccused was trying to remove clothes and undergarments of vict im \nand tried to indulge in intercourse with her.  Victim tried t o escape by \nkicking the accused and made hue and cry.  Thereafter, by hearing th e \nnoise of the victim, her parents and brother came down.  The matter \nwas further handed over to SI Priyanka for necessary action and when \nconcerned SI reached at the house of the complainant to record her \nstatement, she stated that she will give her statement later as she is not \nfeeling well.  On 19.10.2022, complainant came to police stati on and \nher statement was recorded in front of her mother and DCW counselo r \nand on the basis of her statement, aforesaid FIR was got registered \nagainst the petitioner. \n3. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that \npetitioner is the Jeth of the victim and has been falsely im plicated in \nDigitally Signed By:KAMAL\nKANT MENDIRATTA\nSigning Date:28.03.2023\n17:27:32Signature Not Verified\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023:DHC:2200  \nBail Appln. 4/2023                                                                                       Page 3 of 5 \n this case, as the petitioner and the victim are related to each ot her.   It \nis further submitted that victim is in the habit of lodgi ng false FIRs as \nshe is having matrimonial dispute with her husband and she h as \npreviously also falsely implicated four family members along wit h her \nhusband, who are now on bail.  It is further submitted that t he alleged \nincident took place on 11.10.2022 and two PCRs calls were made b y \nthe victim but in none of these calls she stated that petitioner has raped \nher, and even there are no allegations of molestation against the  \npetitioner and the subsequent statement given by her is nothi ng but an \nafterthought to falsely implicate the petitioner.  She further s ubmitted \nthat there is a delay of 8 days in lodging the FIR and even sub sequent \nto the FIR, the victim never came forward to get her statement \nrecorded despite the IO calling her, and it was only on 19.10.2 022 that \nher statement was got recorded. She further submitted that on \n11.10.2022 itself, when the petitioner and the victim were brou ght to \nthe police station after the PCR calls made by the victim, the petitioner  \nhad moved an application stating therein that he has appreh ension that \nhe would be falsely implicated in a rape case. \n4. On the other hand, learned APP for the State while vehemently \nopposing the present bail application has argued on the lines  of the \nstatus report and submitted that on the date of the inciden t i.e, on \n11.10.2022 victim was taken to the hospital for medical ex amination \nand her MLC was prepared wherein she disclosed the entire incident \nand also her statement was recorded before the DCW on the basis of \nwhich the instant FIR was registered. It is further submitted by  the \nDigitally Signed By:KAMAL\nKANT MENDIRATTA\nSigning Date:28.03.2023\n17:27:32Signature Not Verified\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023:DHC:2200  \nBail Appln. 4/2023                                                                                       Page 4 of 5 \n learned APP that in her statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C \nprosecutrix has fully supported the case of the prosecution.   It is \nfurther submitted that proceedings under Section 82 Cr.P.C have bee n \ninitiated against the present petitioner and has placed reliance upon th e \njudgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Prem Shankar \nPrasad Vs. The State of Bihar & Anr in Crl. Appeal No. 1209/202 1, \ndecided on 21.10.2021. \n5. In the instant case, the allegations against the petition er are \ngrave and serious in nature. On 11.10.2022 the victim has \ncategorically stated about the incident which has been recorded by the \ndoctor in the MLC and she has made specific allegations against t he \npetitioner in her statement recorded before DCW and corroborated the \nsame in her statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.  Though \nthere are some minor discrepancies in her two statements i.e., \nstatement made to the doctor and statement before DCW, but the \nvictim has totally corroborated the same and stood by her statem ents.  \nIt is pertinent to note that the petitioner is absconding an d evading his \narrest and thus, PO proceedings have already been initiated agains t the \npetitioner. Looking into the facts and circumstances of this cas e and \ngravity of the offence as well as the fact that process of proclam ation \nunder Section 82 Cr.P.C has been issued, the petitioner is not ent itled \nto the privilege of pre-arrest bail.  \n6. As far as the contention of the counsel for the petitioner that  \ntwo PCR calls were made in which nothing about the incident was  \nmentioned does not cut much ice as there was only 10 minute s gap in \nDigitally Signed By:KAMAL\nKANT MENDIRATTA\nSigning Date:28.03.2023\n17:27:32Signature Not Verified\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023:DHC:2200  \nBail Appln. 4/2023                                                                                       Page 5 of 5 \n the two PCR calls dated 11.10.2022 and the victim was direc tly \nremoved to the hospital from the police station on the same day where \nshe has narrated the whole incident. Therefore, it cannot be said t hat \nthe victim has narrated the incident for the first time on 19.10.2022.   \n7. No doubt, there is a delay of 8 days in lodging the FIR, \nhowever, the delay in such cases is not always fatal to the ca se of the \nprosecution. \n8. Keeping in view the entire circumstances of this case and th e \nfact that the incident recorded in the MLC and the statement before the \nDCW are duly corroborated with the statement of the victim under \nSection 164 Cr.P.C, furthermore, considering that PO proceedings \nhave already been initiated against the petitioner and l ooking into the \nobservations made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Prem Shankar \nPrasad (supra),  no ground for anticipatory bail is made out. The \napplication, is accordingly dismissed. \n9.

The appeal \nDigitally Signed By:TARUN\nRANA\nSigning Date:24.02.2023\n16:48:52Signature Not Verified\n \nNeutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001351 \n \n \nITA 72/2023                                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 7 \n concerns Assessment Year (AY) 2012-13. \n5.   The short point, even according to Mr Zoheb Hossain, who  appears on \nbehalf of the appellant/revenue, is whether the income received b y way of \nfee by the respondent/assessee, is amenable to deduction under Secti on \n10(26AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [in short, “1961 Act”].  \n6.     The facts which have emerged from the record [and which are n ot in \ndispute], are the following: \n(i) The respondent/assessee had filed its return on 29.09.2012 declaring a \nloss of Rs.2,23,585/- after excluding Rs.6,04,06,259/- from its  total income \nby taking recourse to the provisions of Section 10(26AAB) of the 1961 Act . \n(ii) The respondent/assessee is an Agricultural Produce Market ing \nCommittee.  \n(iii) The respondent/assessee’s return was subjected to scrutiny, \nwhereupon an assessment order was framed under Section 143(3) of t he \n1961 Act. The assessed income was pegged at Rs.7,16,62,760/-, after \nmaking various disallowances.  \n(iv) Since the Assessing Officer (AO) [as is apparent from what is stated \nabove] made an addition of Rs. 6,04,06,259/-, it impelled the \nrespondent/assessee to prefer an appeal with the Commissioner of Inc ome \nTax (Appeals) [in short, “CIT(A)”], who ruled in favour of the \nrespondent/assessee. The appellant/revenue, aggrieved by the said  order, \ncarried the matter in appeal to the Tribunal. \n7. Therefore, before the Tribunal, the aspect which arose for \nconsideration was as to whether the fee i.e., income derived by the  \nrespondent/assessee for regulating the market dealing with produ cts such as \nfish, poultry and eggs, would fall within the scope of Sectio n10(26AAB).

Since there is no definition of “agricultural produce” provided in the \n1961 Act, the Tribunal took recourse to the definition provided under \nSection 2 of the Delhi Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, \n1998 [in short, “1998 Act”]. The definition, which has been ex tracted in \nextenso  in the impugned order passed by the Tribunal, along with  the \nschedule, for the sake of convenience, is set forth hereafter: \n“2. Definitions – (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,  \n(a) \"agriculture produce\" means all produce and commodities, whether \nprocessed or unprocessed, of agricultural, horticulture, apiculture, \nviticulture, pisciculture, sericulture, animal husbandry, fleeces and skins of \nanimals and forest products as are specified in the Schedule and such other \nproduce as may be declared by the Government by notification to be an \nagricultural produce and also includes admixture of two or more of such \nproduce. \n \nxxx                                                      xxx                                               xxx \n \nI. Animal Husbandry Products – \n1. Eggs  \n2. Butter \n3. Poultry  \n4. Cattle Meat \n5. Ghee \n6. Goat Meat \n7. Milk & Milk \nII. Apiculture – \n1. Honey \nIII. Cattle Feeds – \nIV. Cereals – \nV.

Oilseeds – Castor seed, Cotton seed, Sarson, Toria etc. \nXII. Pesciculture – Fish  \nXIII. Pulses – Arhar, Beans, Gram, Moth, Mung, Peas etc. \nXIV. Vegetables – Arvi and Arvi Patta, Carrots – all types, Onion etc. \nXV. Horticulture – Flowers, cut flowers and Potted Plants. \nXVI. Forest Products – Bamboo, Baheda, Gum, Honey, Karela, Mahua \nflowers.”  \n[Emphasis is ours] \n \n9. After taking into account the definition and contents of t he schedule \nthe Tribunal made the following observations: \n“21. The above definitions show that DAPM Act does not restrict \nconstitution of committee only for marketing agricultural product. It has \nwithin its scope various other commodities like decorative plants \nproductions of honey and silk. It also includes the marking of forest \nproducts which otherwise do not fall within the definition of agriculture. \nThe DAPM, Act, therefore, has given very wide meaning to the word \nagricultural produce. Apparently, the Income-tax Act has also imported the \nword agricultural produce from the DAPM, Act, 1998 to cover APMC \nnotified under it to provide the benefit to all APMCs provided in the DAPM \nAct or similar Acts, in other states.  It could not have been the intention of \nthe Act to leave out some of the committees, notified under the DAPM \nespecially when all the committees were rendering similar services in \nrespect of various products . \n \nxxx                         xxx                      xxx \n \n23. As discussed above, the word agricultural produce, used in \nconnection with APMC connotes a very wide meaning bringing within its \npreview a large gamut of commodities besides agricultural products. Since \nthe income accrues to the APMCs from pursuing these activities, the \nIncome Tax Act, also perceives a wider meaning by referring to the DAPM . \n \nxxx                         xxx                      xxx \n \n25. It is however observed that the assessee has claimed a loss of \nRs.2,23,585/- in her return of Income. The same represents depreciation for \nthe year, which has not been set off against the profits/income of the \ncommittee. In fact, the assessee has committed a mistake in filing the return, \nwhereby the figure of income Rs.6,04,06,259/- (item 43 of schedule P&L has \nbeen entered as NIL under schedule BP), even otherwise, the profits can be \ncalculated only after deducting the depreciation u/s 32 of the Act. \n \nDigitally Signed By:TARUN\nRANA\nSigning Date:24.02.2023\n16:48:52Signature Not Verified\n \nNeutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001351 \n \n \nITA 72/2023                                                                                                                                 Page 5 of 7 \n 26. Without prejudice to the above, the Supreme Court in the case of CIT \nvs Harprasad & Company (P) Ltd. (99 ITR 118) has held that \"From the \ncharging provisions of the Act, it is discernible that the words 'income' or \n'profits and gains' should be understood as including losses also that, in one \nsense 'profits and gains ' represent plus 'income' whereas losses represent \n'minus income'. In other words, loss is negative profit. Both positive and \nnegative profits are of a revenue character. Both must enter into \ncomputation, wherever it becomes material, in the same mode of the taxable \nincome of the assessee. \" \n \n \n10. Mr Hossain says that the Tribunal has committed an error b y holding \nthat the subject products fell within the scope of the e xpression “agricultural \nproduce”. According to Mr Hossain, agricultural produce will be t hat \nproduce which is yielded in the course of cultivation and not  the kind \nreferred to in the Tribunal’s order.  \n10.1. Mr Hossain goes on to argue that since the income earned by the \nrespondent/assessee is not derived from agricultural produce, the \nrespondent/assessee could not have excluded it from its total income by \ntaking recourse to the provisions of Section 10(26AAB) of the 1961 Act. \n11.     It is, however, not disputed by Mr Hossain that the d efinition of the \nexpression “agricultural produce” is not provided in the 1961  Act. Before \nwe proceed further, it would be relevant to extract the provision in issue, i.e., \nSection 10(26AAB) of the 1961 Act: \n \n“Section 10(26AA B): any income  of an agricultural produce market \ncommittee or board constituted under any law for the time being in force  for \nthe purpose of regulating the marketing of agricultural produce ” \n \n[Emphasis is ours] \n \n11.1, This definition, if broken down, would entail the followi ng: \n(i) It concerns “ any income ” of the Agricultural Produce Market \nDigitally Signed By:TARUN\nRANA\nSigning Date:24.02.2023\n16:48:52Signature Not Verified\n \nNeutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001351 \n \n \nITA 72/2023                                                                                                                                 Page 6 of 7 \n Committee or Board. \n(ii) The said Agricultural Produce Market Committee or Board shoul d be \none, which is, constituted under any law in force. \n(iii) The income earned by the Agricultural Produce Market Commit tee or \nBoard should have nexus with the purpose of regulating the market ing of \nagricultural produce. \n12. Therefore, the argument advanced by Mr Hossain, on behalf of the \nappellant/revenue, that unless income which is earned is relata ble to \nagricultural produce, it cannot be kept out of the pale of total i ncome of the \nassessee, is clearly not tenable, since the expression incorporated  in Section \n10(26AAB ) of the 1961 Act is “any income” and not “agricultural income” \nof the Agricultural Produce Market Committee or Board.  \n13. In the given case, admittedly, the respondent/assessee earned  a fee. \nThe facts, as disclosed, are that the wholesalers of the produce bri ng their \nproducts, which include fish, poultry and eggs, to the des ignated spots where \nthey are cleaned, sorted and sold to the traders.  \n13.1.  It is on this account that the fee is earned by the respo ndent/assessee. \nThe fee that the respondent/assessee obtains helps the purpose for w hich it is \nconstituted i.e., regulating the marketing of agricultural produce.  \n14. Since “agricultural produce” is not defined in the 1961 Act, the \nTribunal, as noted above, has taken recourse to Section 2 of the 1 998 Act. \n14.1.    The respondent/assessee has been constituted under th e Delhi \nAgricultural Marketing (Regulation) Act 1976 and was appoi nted as \nregulator under the 1998 Act to facilitate trading in fish, poultry and e ggs. \n14.2.    The definition of agricultural produce, as contained in  Section \n2(1)(a) of the 1998 Act, read with schedule, as extracted above, is wi de, \nDigitally Signed By:TARUN\nRANA\nSigning Date:24.02.2023\n16:48:52Signature Not Verified\n \nNeutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001351 \n \n \nITA 72/2023                                                                                                                                 Page 7 of 7 \n which includes all kinds of produce, including fish, poultr y, and eggs. \nTherefore, even otherwise, the fee earned by the respondent/assessee, as \nheld by the Tribunal, would constitute income derived from  regulating \nagricultural produce.  \n15. Thus, according to us, the conclusion reached via the impugned order \nby the Tribunal is unimpeachable and does not need any interd iction by this \ncourt.  \n16.

The application is, accordingly, disposed of. \nITA 108/2023  \n6. This appeal is directed against the order of the Income Tax Appellate \nTribunal [in short, “the Tribunal” ] dated 03.04.2019 concerning Assessment \nYear (AY) 2006-07. \n7. The short point which arose for consideration before the Tri bunal was \nwhether or not the calculation of disallowable expenses made b y the \nrespondent/assessee, on its own, under Section 14A of the Income Tax  Act, \n1961 [in short “Act”] was correct.  \n8. To be noted, the respondent/assessee had earned dividend i ncome \namounting to Rs. 86,88,44,673/-, which was excluded from tot al income in \nterms of Section 10(34) of the Act. \n9. The respondent/assessee had, on its own as indicated abov e, worked \nout disallowance under Section 14A of the Act to the extent of Rs. \n55,59,79,000/-.  \n10. The breakup of this amount, as per the record, is as follows: \n(i) Rs 55,37,89,473/- was attributed to interest expenses, whi le the \nremaining amount, i.e., Rs 21,89,527/- was attributed to adminis trative \nexpenses, albeit  based on estimation. \n11. In sum, the respondent/assessee has taken the stand that it had \nincurred a cumulative amount of Rs. 55,59,79,000/- to earn the afore-\nmentioned dividend income and, therefore, this amount had to be disallowed \nas an expenditure under Section 14A of the Act. \n12. The Tribunal has accepted the method of calculation put fort h by the \nrespondent/assessee, and in this behalf, has observed that the method \nadopted in the AY in issue, was also followed, as well as accept ed by the \nDigitally Signed By:PREM\nMOHAN CHOUDHARY\nSigning Date:24.03.2023\n20:19:53Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO:2023:DHC:2140-DB \n \nITA 108/2023 Page       3 of 4 \n appellant/revenue, in other assessment years.  \n12.1 Observations in this behalf are recorded in paragraph 12, 13 and 14 of \nthe impugned order. \n12.2 The Tribunal invoked the rule of consistency as enuncia ted by the \nSupreme Court in Radha Soami Satsang v Commissioner of Income Tax \n[1992] 193 ITR 321  and, thus, dismissed the appeal of the revenue. \n13. We may note that the respondent/assessee had also filed cross-appeal \nagainst the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [in short, \n“CIT(A)”], to the extent that he had upheld the disallowance of amount \nequivalent to Rs 1.97 crores on account of administrative personal expen ses. \n14. The Tribunal via impugned order dismissed the appeal of the \nrespondent/assessee.  \n15. It is also pertinent to note that the appellant/revenu e took recourse to \nprovisions of Rule 8D of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 to support  its plea that \nthe disallowance had to be calculated through different methodolog y.  \n16. The Tribunal held that the said rule was applicable onl y from AY \n2008-09. \n16.1 In this context, Mr Zoheb Hossain, who appears on behalf o f the \nappellant/revenue, does not dispute this aspect of the matter, in  view of the \njudgment rendered by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax \n5 Mumbai Vs. Essar Teleholdings Ltd.  (2018) 3 SCC 253. \n17.

(Oral):  \nCM Appl.16017/2023  [Application filed on behalf of the \nappellant/revenue seeking condonation of delay of 640 days in re- filing \nthe appeal.] \n1.  This is an application filed on behalf of the appella nt/revenue, \nseeking condonation of delay in re-filing the appeal.  \n1.1 According to the appellant/revenue, there is a delay of 640 days. \n2. Mr Shashwat Bajpai, who appears on behalf of the non-\napplicant/respondent/assessee, does not oppose the prayer made in the  \napplication.  \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n16:29:11Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:3678-DB \n \nITA 196/2023     Pg. 2 of 5 \n 3. The delay is condoned.  The application is, accordingly, disposed of. \nITA 196/2023  \n2. This appeal concerns Assessment Year (AY) 1987-88.  The appeal \nseeks to challenge the order dated 13.08.2018 passed by the Income Tax \nAppellate Tribunal [in short, the “Tribunal”].   \n3. The short issue which arose for consideration before the Tribunal was \nwhether interest under Section 220(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [ in short, \nthe “Act”] was payable by the respondent/assessee, in respect of the demand \nraised via the order dated 29.03.1990. \n3.1 This assessment order was passed under Section 143(3) of the Act.   \n3.2 By virtue of this order, the respondent/assessee’s income was assessed \nat Rs. 11,40,79,686/-. \n4. It is important to note that the appellant/revenue, being a ggrieved by \nthe aforesaid order, preferred an appeal with the Commissioner of I ncome \nTax (Appeals) [in short, “CIT(A)”].  \n4.1 The CIT(A), via the order dated 30.06.1999, reduced the \nrespondent/assessee ’s income to Rs.5,83,45,420/-. \n5. The record shows that the Assessing Officer (AO), while giving effect \nto the order passed by the CIT(A), reduced the income to Rs.5,60,33,906/-.   \n5.1 It appears that since the respondent/assessee was dissatisfie d with the \norder of the CIT(A) dated 30.06.1999 (which is referred to hereinabove), an  \nappeal was preferred with the Tribunal.   \n5.2 Likewise, the appellant/revenue also preferred an appeal wit h the \nTribunal.   \n6. The Tribunal, via order dated 22.07.1996, passed a common order. \nResultantly, the assessed income of the respondent/assessee wa s got scaled \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n16:29:11Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:3678-DB \n \nITA 196/2023     Pg. 3 of 5 \n down to Rs.92,49,259/-.   \n7. The AO gave effect to the said order passed by the Tribunal  on \n29.04.1997.  The appeal effect order, i.e., the order dated 29.04.1 997, \npegged the respondent/assessee’s assessed income at Rs.66,80,645/ -. \n8. What is not in dispute is that the CIT(A), with regard to the preceding \nassessment year, i.e., AY 1986-87, had passed the order on 07.06.2 002, \ndirecting the AO to consider allowing deduction towards exci se duty paid by \nthe respondent/assessee amounting to Rs.88,80,941/- in the sai d AY, with a \ncaveat that if the deduction was allowed for AY 1986-87, the AO should \nwithdraw the equivalent claim which had already been allowed  in the \nsubsequent AY, i.e., AY 1987-88.   \n9. Pursuant to the order dated 07.06.2002, the AO on 15.0 9.2014 passed \nan order qua AY 1986-87, allowing the deduction of Rs. 88, 80,941 for AY \n1986/87. \n9.1 Consequently, via a separate order i.e., order dated 21.05.2014, the \nAO recomputed the taxable income of the respondent/assessee for AY 1987-\n88, by adding Rs.88,80,914/- to the respondent/assessee’s income.   \n9.2 Furthermore, the AO also levied interest amounting to Rs. \n1,62,85,376 under Section 220(2) of the Act for the period spa nning \nbetween 01.05.1990 and 15.09.2014.   \n10. It is against this order of the AO that the respondent/as sessee \npreferred an appeal with the CIT(A).  The CIT(A), via order dated \n14.11.2014, concluded that as the demand under Section 156 o f the Act was \nraised for the first time on 15.09.2014, and since there was no  default, \ninterest under the said provisions should not be levied.   \n11. This time around, the appellant/revenue, being aggrieved, p referred an \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n16:29:11Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:3678-DB \n \nITA 196/2023     Pg. 4 of 5 \n appeal with the Tribunal.  The Tribunal, via the impugned order, sustained \nthe view taken by the CIT(A) as regards levy of interest under Section \n220(2) of the Act.   \n11.1 In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has noted th e following \nfacts, which decidedly emerged from the record: \n(i) First, that the assessment order dated 29.03.1990 did n ot morph \ninto a demand notice. \n(ii) Second, that the income assessed initially at Rs. 11,40,79,68 6/- \nvia the assessment order dated 29.03.1990, i.e., did not concern \nitself with the excise duty component which, as noticed abo ve, \nwas later on added to the assessed income of the \nrespondent/assessee in respect of the AY in issue i.e., AY 1987-\n88. \n(iii) Third, that the demand arose for the first time pursuant  to the \norder of the CIT(A) concerning the earlier assessment year i.e., \nAY 1986-87.    \n12. Given these facts, there is no dispute that no demand noti ce was \nraised under Section 156 of the Act, when the assessment order date d \n29.03.1990 was passed.   \n13. As noticed hereinabove, the demand notice, for the first tim e, was \nissued only on 15.09.2014.  The crucial question which, therefore, arises for \nconsideration is: whether the period prior to 15.09.2014 will come withi n the \nsway of sub-section (2) of Section 220 of the Act.   \n14. To our minds, plain language of sub-section (2) of Secti on 220 shows \nthat the liability to pay interest would arise only with  respect to the amount \nspecified in the notice of demand issued under Section 156 of the Act, which \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n16:29:11Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:3678-DB \n \nITA 196/2023     Pg. 5 of 5 \n is not paid within the prescribed time. \n15. Given the facts which have emerged in this case, the demand noticed \nwas issued only on 15.09.2014. Therefore, the order of the AO  seeking to \nlevy interest for the period spanning between 01.05.1990 and 1 5.09.2014, in \nour view, cannot be sustained. This conclusion reached by b oth the CIT(A) \nand Tribunal, in our opinion, does not call for interference.   \n16. Resultantly, no substantial question of law arises for o ur \nconsideration.  The appeal is, accordingly, closed.     \n \nRAJIV SHAKDHER, J  \n \n \nTARA VITASTA GANJU, J  \n APRIL 6, 2023 /pmc  \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n16:29:11Signature Not Verified",

It is stated that as per the tender document, the Petitioner herein \nexecuted a Non-Disclosure Obligation Agreement ( hereinafter referred to as \n„the NDA‟ ) and uploaded the same on the e-procurement portal of NIC on \n26.07.2022. It is stated that the Respondent herein, after consi dering the \nNDA submitted by the Petitioner herein allowed the Petitioner to make a \npayment of Rs.2,36,000/- towards cost of Bidding Document.

The Petitioner has, therefore, approached this Court by filing t he \ninstant Writ Petition stating that the reason for rejecting t he bid was only a \nmissing formal sentence in the Bank Guarantee that could not be a valid \nground for rejection of the bid. \n8. The matter came up for hearing on 06.09.2022 and this Court directe d \nthe Respondent herein to file a detailed reply in the matter. \n9. Reply has been filed. In the reply, Respondent herein has raised a \npreliminary objection on the maintainability of the instant Writ Petition.

It is stated that the bidding documents are based on JICA’s  Standard \nBidding Documents unde r Japanese ODA loans of JICA as well as JICA’s \nprocurement guidelines under Japanese ODA Loans and JICA has app ointed \nJapan International Consultants Consortium (JICC) as the consulta nt for \ndesign and drafting of the bidding documents for the project p ackages \nincluding evaluation of bids and the process of bidding and the subsequent \ndecisions are to be vetted by JICA. It is further stated that f our bids, \nincluding the bid of the Petitioner, was received by the Responde nt and as \nper the Japanese ODA Loan, all the four technical bids were sent to JICC for \nevaluation on 04.11.2022. It is stated that the Technical B id Evaluation \nReport (TBER) dated 16.12.2022 was received by the Respondent from JICC \nand the Internal Tender Committee of the Respondent made \nrecommendations in respect of the TBER and forwarded the same to JICA \non 17.12.2022 and after receiving the approval from JICA, the  resu lt of the \ntechnical bid evaluation was notified to all the bidders on  27.12.2022. It is \nstated that it is only after a detailed evaluation conducted by JICC and the \nInternal Tender Committee of the respondent and approval by JICA, the \ntechnical bid of the Petitioner herein was rejected for being non res ponsive \nand the price bid of other three bidders was opened on 28.12.2022 as their \ntechnical bid was approved by JICA to be substantially responsive. \n11. It is stated by the Respondent that the instant Writ Petiti on is pre-\nmature as the parties are bound by Clause 28.1 of Instructions t o Bidders for \nnot disclosing the reasons to the Bidders until informatio n on contract award \nis communicated to all the bidders in accordance with Clause 4 2 of the \nInstructions to Bidders.

Heard the Counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. \n13. Clause 28.1 & 42.5 of the Instructions to Bidders, on which reli ance \nhas been placed by the Respondent, reads as under: \n“28.1 Information relating to the evaluation of Bids \nand recommendation of Contract award, shall not be \ndisclosed to Bidders or any other persons not official ly \nconcerned with such process until information on \nContract award is communicated to all Bidders in \naccordance with 1TB 42.  \n***** \n42.5 After notification of award, unsuccessful Bidders \nmay request , in writing, to the Employer a debriefing \nseeking explanations on the grounds on which their \nBids were not selected. The Employer shall promptly \nrespond in writing , to any unsuccessful Bidders who, \nafter the notification of the award in accordance with \nITB 42.1 , request a debriefing. ”  \n   \n14. A similar issued was raised before the Apex Court in Nationa l High \nSpeed Rail Corpn. Ltd. v. Montecarlo Ltd. , (2022) 6 SCC 401.  The case \ndealt with the very same Clauses on which reliance has been placed  in the \npresent case. In the said case, the High Court had allowed the W rit Petition \nfiled by the bidder therein and had quashed the communication informing th e \nbidder therein about rejection of his bid on the ground of bein g non-\nresponsive and the Apex Court, after discussing the entire agree ment and the \ncase laws on the point, has observed as under: \n“29. Thus, from the aforesaid decisions, it can be seen \nthat a court before interfering in a contract matter in \nexercise of powers of judicial review should pose to \nitself the following questions: \n \n(i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by \nthe authority is mala fide or intended to favour \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SHAZAAD ZAKIR\nSigning Date:22.02.2023\n14:55:50Signature Not Verified\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001266 \nW.P.(C) 32/2023    Page 7 of 14 \n someone; or whether the process adopted or decision \nmade is so arbitrary and irrational that the court ca n \nsay:“the decision is such that no responsible authority \nacting reasonably and in accordance with relevant law \ncould have reached”? And  \n \n(ii) Whether the public interest is affected? \n \nIf the answers to the above questions are in the \nnegative, then there should be no interference under \nArticle 226.  \n \n30. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the \naforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand an d \nwhen a conscious decision was taken by JICC/JICA \nholding the bid submitted by the original writ petitio ner \nas non-responsive/non-compliant to the technical \nrequirements of the bidding documents and suffering \nfrom material deviation, we are of the opinion that the \nHigh Court has erred in interfering with the tender \nprocess and interfering with the decision of JICC/JICA \nrejecting the bid submitted by the original writ \npetitioner at technical stage. \n \n31. At the outset, it is to be noted that the bid submitted  \nby the original writ petitioner was rejected at the first \nstage on the ground of material deviation/non-\nresponsive and having found that the tender submitted \nby the original writ petitioner was not found to be as \nper the terms and conditions of the tender document. \nHowever, the High Court by the impugned judgment \nand order [Montecarlo Ltd. v.

Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine Del 4112] has set \naside the conscious decision taken by JICA, JICC and \nthe appellant by observing that the bid submitted by the \noriginal writ petitioner can be said to be in substantia l \ncompliance and on the ground that though the other \nbidders were given opportunity to correct their \nerrors/defects, however, the original writ petitioner was \nnot afforded the same opportunity and therefore the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SHAZAAD ZAKIR\nSigning Date:22.02.2023\n14:55:50Signature Not Verified\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001266 \nW.P.(C) 32/2023    Page 8 of 14 \n decision not to give opportunity to correct the \ndefects/errors can be said to be discriminatory and \nviolative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. \n \n***** \n40. Under the circumstances, the High Court has erred \nin interfering with the conscious decision of \nJICC/JICA/appellant/Tender Committee to reject the \nbid submitted by the original writ petitioner at Stage I  \non the ground that the bid submitted by the original \nwrit petitioner was suffering from material deviation. \n \n41. Now so far as the view taken by the High Court in \nthe impugned judgment and order [Montecarlo Ltd. v. \nNational High Speed Rail Corpn. Ltd., 2021 SCC \nOnLine Del 4112] that Clause 28 under Clause (e) of \nOption A Section 1 and Clause 42.5 of ITB are \npatently illegal, inasmuch as they seek to curtail the \nright of the bidders to challenge the rejection of their \nbid in a multi-stage bidding process at the earliest, \nand before the award of the contract is concerned, at \nthe outset, it is required to be noted that as such the \naforesaid clauses of ITB were not under challenge \nbefore the High Court. Even otherwise, it is required \nto be noted that Clauses 28.1 and 42.5 of ITB were \nwell within the knowledge of the original writ \npetitioner at the time of participating in the tender \nprocess. The aforesaid clauses of ITB were put to the \nknowledge of all the participants/bidders and the same \napplied to all. Despite the above clauses in ITB, the \noriginal writ petitioner participated in the tender \nprocess. Therefore, once having accepted the terms \nand conditions of the tender process with the full \nknowledge of Clauses 28.1 and 42.5, and participated \nwith full knowledge, thereafter, it was not open for th",

Estate, Central District, Delhi for the offences punishab le \nunder Sections 328/376/354D/506/34/376D of the Indian Penal Co de, \n1860 (“IPC”).  \n6. Issue notice. Mr. Naresh Kumar Chahar, learned APP for the \nState accepts notice. \n7. Brief facts of present case, as per the material on record, are \nthat the complainant is a student of Mata Sundari College, Del hi and \non the pretext of giving notes of B.Com Second year, the accused, \nwho is serving as a security guard in the college on a cont ractual \nbasis, took the complainant/prosecutrix to sports complex and forced \nhimself upon the prosecutrix and committed rape upon her. Further, i t \nis alleged by the complainant that she was threatened to be ki lled by \nelder brother, parents, three friends and an uncle of the petitioner. \nInitially an FIR bearing no. 90/2019 was registered against the \naccused for the offences punishable under Sections 376/328/506/34 \nand later Sections 354D/376D were added based on the complaint.  \n8. Learned counsel appearing for petitioner states that the \napplicant is in judicial custody since 08.05.2019.

It is \nfurther stated by learned counsel for applicant that the accus ed is in \njudicial custody since his arrest in this case except for a br ief period \nof one month when he was granted bail. It is also stated b y learned \ncounsel that applicant was unable to convey to his previo us counsel \nregarding the WhatsApp chats and the photographs which were in his \npossession and the same being crucial evidence needs to be put  to the \nprosecutrix for the purpose of cross-examination.  \n9. On the other hand, learned APP for the State states that the \nprosecutrix in this case has been cross-examined at length and a \ndetailed cross-examination has been conducted by the learned \ncounsel which runs into 9 pages. It is therefore, stated that the pr esent \npetition is liable to be rejected.  \n10. Heard.  \n11. Before going into the facts of the case, it would be appropriate \nto reproduce Section 311 of the Cr.P.C., which reads as under:  \n “311. Power to summon material witness, or examine \nperson present. —Any Court may, at any stage of any \ninquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summo n \nany person as a witness, or examine any person in \nattendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall \nand re-examine any person already examined; and the \nCourt shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine \nany such person if his evidence appears to it to be essenti al \nto the just decision of the case.”  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\nSigning Date:06.01.2023\n19:48:40Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/000084 \nCRL. REV.P. 5/2023                                                                                             Page 4 of 7 \n 12. Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Varsha Garg v. The \nState of Madhya Pradesh & Ors., 2022 SCC OnLine SC 986 , held \nas under:  \n“32. This power can be exercised at any stage of any inquiry,  \ntrial or other proceeding under the CrPC. The latter part of  \nSection 311 states that the Court “shall” summon and exam ine \nor recall and re- examine any such person “if his evidence \nappears to the Court to be essential to the just decision  of the \ncase”. Section 311 contains a power upon the Court in broad  \nterms. The statutory provision must be read purposively, to \nachieve the intent of the statute to aid in the discovery of truth.  \n******  \n37. The power of the court is not constrained by the closur e of \nevidence. Therefore, it is amply clear from the above \ndiscussion that the broad powers under Section 311 are to  be \ngoverned by the requirement of justice. The power must be \nexercised wherever the court finds that any evidence is \nessential for the just decision of the case. The statutory \nprovision goes to emphasise that the court is not a hapless \nbystander in the derailment of justice. Quite to the contrar y, \nthe court has a vital role to discharge in ensuring that the \ncause of discovering truth as an aid in the realization of justice \nis manifest.”  \n     ****** \n13. Also relying in the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh \n(5) v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 3 SCC 374,  which was reiterated in \nthe recent case of Godrej Pacific Tech. Ltd.  v. Computer Joint India \nLtd., (2008) 11 SCC 108 , the issue was dealt by the Hon’ble Court \nregarding the allowing the application of Section 311 and it was \nnoted that:-  \n“28. The court is not empowered under the provisions \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\nSigning Date:06.01.2023\n19:48:40Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/000084 \nCRL. REV.P. 5/2023                                                                                             Page 5 of 7 \n of the Code to compel either the prosecution or the defe nce to \nexamine any particular witness or witnesses on their side. Th is \nmust be left to the parties. But in weighing the \nevidence, the court can take note of the fact that the bes t \navailable evidence has not been given, and can draw an \nadverse inference. The court will often have to depend on \nintercepted allegations made by the parties, or on inco nclusive \ninference from facts elicited in the evidence. In such \ncases, the court has to act under the second part of the section. \nSometimes the examination of witnesses as directed \nby the court may result in what is thought to be \n“filling  of loopholes”. That is purely a subsidiary factor and \ncannot be taken into account . Whether the new evidence is \nessential or not must of course depend on the facts of  each \ncase, and has to be determined by the Presiding Judge.”  \n(emphasis supplied)  \n14. Coming back to the present case, the FIR bearing no. 90/2019 \nhas been registered for the offences punishable under Sections \n328/376/354D/506/34/376D of IPC and prosecutrix was exami ned on \n09.12.2021. On, 06.05.2022, an application under Section 311  of \nCr.P.C. was filed by the accused for re-call of prosecutrix for re-\ncross-examination, however, the same was rejected by the learned \nTrial Court vide order dated 26.07.2022 on the ground that cross -\nexamination was conducted by the learned counsel for accused in \ndetail.  \n15. Ensuring fair trial is a fundamental right of the accused under \nArticle 21 of the Constitution of India and in case of Rajendra \nPrasad v.  Narcotic Cell, (1999) 6 SCC 110  it was held that:- \n“8. Lacuna in the prosecution must be understood as the \ninherent weakness or a latent wedge in the matrix \nof the prosecution case. The advantage of it should nor mally \ngo to the accused in the trial of the case, but an over sight \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\nSigning Date:06.01.2023\n19:48:40Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/000084 \nCRL.

No party in a trial can be foreclosed from \ncorrecting errors. If proper evidence was not adduced or a \nrelevant material was not brought on record due to any \ninadvertence, the court should be magnanimous in \npermitting such mistakes to be rectified . After all, \nfunction of the criminal court is administration of  criminal \njustice and not to count errors committed by the parti es or to \nfind out and declare who among the parties performed better.”  \n     (emphasis supplied)  \n16. After hearing learned counsel for both the parties and perusing \nthe material on record, this Court is of the opinion that W hatsApp \nchats and the photographs are required to be put to the prosecutrix for  \nreaching just decision of the present case. The Court takes note of t he \nfact that the accused is in judicial custody since 08.05.2019  and it \nmay have been possible that he was not be able to assist his co unsel \nor hand over the six photographs and WhatsApp chats runn ing into \n13 pages. Though, change of counsel cannot be a ground for recalling \na witness for cross-examination as has been laid down in severa l \njudgments of the Hon’ble Apex Court , however, depending upon \ncircumstances and facts of each case, Courts are vested with po wer \nunder Section 311 of Cr.P.C. to exercise the said discretion as \nmentioned above. The photographs and the WhatsApp chats anne xed \nwith the present petition are essential to be put to the p rosecutrix for \nthe purpose of cross-examination which could not be put t o her for \nthe reasons mentioned above. \n17. In view of the above, the present petition is allowed on the \nfollowing conditions:  \ni) That the PW-3/Prosecutrix will be cross-examined in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ZEENAT PRAVEEN\nSigning Date:06.01.2023\n19:48:40Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/000084 \nCRL.

The appellant has filed the present appeal impugning an order\ndated 06.07.2018 passed by the Customs, Excise & Service Tax\nAppellate Tribunal, New Delhi in Appeal No.ST/53655/2015. The\nappellant states that the said order was received on 23.07.2018. The\npresent appeal was filed on 31.05.2019, almost 10 months after the\nreceipt of the impugned order.\n2. The appellant had also filed an application seeking condonatio n\nDigitally Signed\nBy:Dushyant Rawal\nSigning Date:03.04.2023Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:2329-DB\nSERTA No.3/2022 Page 2 of 5of delay, stating that the delay ‘ is due to misplacement of some of the\nfile papers in the office which were recovered later on and the matter\nfurther got delayed due to oversight and inadvertence .’ Apart from the\naforesaid, no other reason for condoning the delay was mentioned in t he\napplication (CM. APPL. 9867/2022). Further, the application also did\nnot specify the period of delay. Since the prayer clause of the said clau se\ndid not specify the number of days of delay, which the appellant prayed\nfor being condoned, the appellant was given an opportunity to file a\nbetter application.\n3. Thereafter, the appellant filed another application (CM\nNO.33370/2022) further improving the reasons as stated in the first\napplication. The reasons for seeking condonation of delay as stated in\nthe said application are set out below:-\n“3. That the delay which has occurred in filling the appeal is due\nmisplacement of some of the file papers in the office of the\ncounsel which were recovered later on and the matter further\ngot delayed due oversight and inadvertence.\n4. That upon the receipt of the aforesaid impugned order in the\noffice of the appellant, the same was then sent to the Review\nBranch for taking a decision as to whether the said order has\nto be challenge/appeal against or note. The review branch,\nafter carefully going through entire case and after analyzing\nthe legal position, came to a conclusion that the impugned\norder passed by the Ld. Tribunal deserved to be challenged\nbefore this Hon'ble Court and thereafter the appeal papers\nwere sent to the counsel for the appellant.\n5. That, owing to the bulky nature of the appeal, some papers\nwere inadvertently left out when the matter was handed over\nto the counsel for the appellant and thereafter upon a request\nbeing made by the counsel to the department for complete\nDigitally Signed\nBy:Dushyant Rawal\nSigning Date:03.04.2023Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:2329-DB\nSERTA No.3/2022 Page 3 of 5transmission for the filed on 23.01.2019, the appellant\ndepartment sent the complete records vide mail on\n25.01.2019. Thereafter copies of orders relied upon by the\nLd. Tribunal in the impugned judgment were also sought for\nand which was later on provided by the appellant\ndepartment to the counsel. The status as to whether the\nrelied upon judgment had been appealed against or not or\nwhether it had attained finality or not was also ascertained\nby the counsel and in which process was some time was\nlost.”\n4. Although the appellant had somewhat improved its explanation\nfor the reasons which had led to the delay in filing the present appeal, i t\nis apparent that the same were also wanting in particulars.\n5. It is well settled that each day of delay in filing has to be\nexplained. In the present case, there are large gaps in the time period\nfor which no ostensible reason has been provided.\n6. The appellant has not only delayed in filing the present appeal\nbut there is also an unexplained and inordinate delay in re-filing t he\nappeal. The above captioned appeal was filed on 31.05.2019. It was\nreturned under objection on 10.06.2019. This was because the court fee\nwas missing and the title was incorrect, apart from other defects. The\ndefects were not cured for more than two months thereafter. The appeal\nwas re-filed on 19.08.2019, however, the same was still defective. It is\nmaterial to note that the appellant had not filed a hard copy as required .\nThus, the appeal was retuned on 20.08.2019. Thereafter, there was\ncomplete inaction for more than two years and five months. Even if the\nperiod commencing from 15.03.2020 is excluded on account of\ndisruption caused due to outbreak of covid 19. There was a period of\nsix months between the date on which the appeal was marked as\nDigitally Signed\nBy:Dushyant Rawal\nSigning Date:03.04.2023Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:2329-DB\nSERTA No.3/2022 Page 4 of 5defective and the date when the lockdown was imposed in the wake of\nthe pandemic.\n7. There is no explanation for this inordinate delay as well.\n8. In the case of Post Master General and Ors. v. Living Media\nIndia Ltd and Anr.: (2012) 3 SCC 563; the Supreme Court had\nobserved as under:\n“27.It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or\nconversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period\nof limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a special\nleave petition in this Court. They cannot claim that they have a\nseparate period of limitation when the Department was possessed\nwith competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the\nabsence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a\nquestion why the delay is to be condoned mechanically merely\nbecause the Government or a wing of the Government is a party\nbefore us.\n28.Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation\nof delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction\nor lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to\nadvance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and\ncircumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various\nearlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery\nand inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes\ncannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being used\nand available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody,\nincluding the Government.\n29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies,\ntheir agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have\nreasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was\nbona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation\nthat the file was kept pending for several months/years due to\nconsiderable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The\ngovernment departments are under a special obligation to ensure\nthat they perform their duties with diligence and commitment.\nCondonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an\nanticipated benefit for the government departments. The law\nshelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled\nfor the benefit of a few.”\nDigitally Signed\nBy:Dushyant Rawal\nSigning Date:03.04.2023Signature Not Verified\n2023:DHC:2329-DB\nSERTA No.3/2022 Page 5 of 59.

Consequently, the\nappeal is dismissed as well.\nVIBHU BAKHRU, J\nAMIT MAHAJAN, J\nMARCH 28, 2023\nCh\nDigitally Signed\nBy:Dushyant Rawal\nSigning Date:03.04.2023Signature Not Verified",

JUSTICE DINESH KUMAR SHARMA \n \nJ U D G M E N T  \n \nDINESH KUMAR SHARMA, J. (Oral)  \n \n1. The present appeal has been filed challenging the order dated \n10.01.2019 passed by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Bench \n“E” New Delhi in ITA No.6126/DEL/2014 and Co No.165/DEL/20 15 \nin ITA No.6126/DEL/2014 for Assessment Year 2008-09. \n2. The appellant has stated that the assessee has filed return o f income for \nassessment year 2008-09 declaring an income of Rs.2,82,271/- unde r \nSection 139 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as \n„the Act‟ ) \n3. On 28.09.2010, search and seizure operation under Section 132 of the \nAct was carried out in Triveni Group and a search warrant under \nSection 132 (1) of the Act was issued and executed in the name of t he \nDigitally Signed By:RAJ\nBALA\nSigning Date:02.05.2022\n18:58:17Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 129/2022 Page 2 of 7 assessee as well.  The assessee belongs to the Triveni Group .  A notice \nunder Section 153A of the Act was also issued to the assessee. \n4. Pursuant to the notices issued under Section 142 (1) of the A ct to the \nassessee on 12.09.2012 and 26.09.2012, the assessee filed return  of \nincome for the concerned year declaring an income of Rs.7,26,490/-. \n5. The Assessing Officer found cash amounting to Rs.5,05,90,000/- \ncredited in asse ssee‟s bank account bearing no.049010100313087 in \nAxis Bank Limited.  The cash flow statement filed by the assessee wa s \nnot accepted by the Assessing Officer except to the extent of \nRs.4,00,000/- and this sum was allowed by the AO being wit hdrawal \nmade by the assessee on 19.09.2007.  The assessing officer added a \nsum of Rs.5,01,90,000/- as unexplained cash in the income of the \nassessee under Section 68 of the Act.   \n6. In regard to the another addition of Rs.5,01,90,000/-, the CIT (A) \ntransmitted the documents submitted by the assessee to the A ssessing \nofficer  called upon him to submit the report.  However, the A ssessing \nofficer did not respond. CIT (A) in order to ascertain the authenti city of \nthe return of income, identity and creditworthiness of each of t he \npartners addressed a letter to the Directorate of Income Tax (Syste ms) \nand obtained a report.  The CIT (A) partly allowed the appeal of the \nassessee on the issue of addition of Rs.5,01,90,000/- .  The CIT (A) h as \nheld that the source of credit to the extent of Rs.43,62,500/- comp rising \nof sums received from Mittal Tin container (Rs.41,00,000/-) and Vivek \nCommodities (Rs.2,62,500/-) was confirmed and the source of balance \nof Rs.4,58,27,500/- was considered to have been explained.   \nDigitally Signed By:RAJ\nBALA\nSigning Date:02.05.2022\n18:58:17Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 129/2022 Page 3 of 7 7. The revenue preferred an appeal before the ITAT against the order of \nthe CIT (A). The ITAT confirmed the order of the CIT (A) and the \nappeal of the department was dismissed. \n8. The department in the present appeal has only challenged the order of \nITAT deleting the addition of Rs.4,63,18,300/- (on account  of \nunexplained cash credit and income from undisclosed sources).   \n9. The department has challenged the order of the ITAT on the gro und \nthat the Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the assessee had deposited  \nRs.5,01,90,000/- in cash on different dates in his bank account \nmaintained with Axis Bank.  The assessee submitted his cash fl ow \nwherein it was noticed that the money has been received from M/s  \nTriveni Infrastructure Development Company Ltd. (TIDCO), M/s \nTriveni Motors, M/s Vivek Commodities and Ms.Mittal Infrastruc ture \nTin Containers Ltd.  However, the assessee did not give any evi dence \nto substantiate such receipt and therefore the same was rightly t reated \nas unexplained credit in terms of Section 68 of the Act.  The ap pellant \nstated that the assessee did not produce enough material to pro ve the \ngenuineness of the transactions.  It was stated that the asses see was \nunder a legal obligation to prove the receipt of money to the  \nsatisfaction of the Assessing officer. \n10. The department has also assailed the finding of the ITAT on the ground \nthat a blind reliance on the Cash Flow Statement and Report of DIT \n(System) has wrongly been made and the same has to be corroborated \nby the other substantial evidence.   \n11. Mr.Ruchir Bhatia, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant \nhas stated that the order of the ITAT is liable to be set asid e as it \nDigitally Signed By:RAJ\nBALA\nSigning Date:02.05.2022\n18:58:17Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 129/2022 Page 4 of 7 miserably failed to appreciate that the assessee had been disbeli eved by \nthe Assessing officer after establishing infirmity or fallacy in the \ndocuments produced by him. \n12. Mr.Bhatia has submitted that the assessee could not produce any formal \ncorroborative evidence of having received respective amounts to \ncorroborate the cash flow statement.  Mr.Bhatia further stated that \nITAT has wrongly relied upon the cash flow statement and report of \nDIT (systems). \n13. It has further been stated that the CIT (A) could not have partak en the \nrole of the Assessing officer and satisfy itself regarding the genuineness \nand creditworthiness of the parties. Mr.Bhatia has further stated that the  \nITAT has also failed to appreciate the real intent of Section 68 of the \nAct. \n14. We have considered the submissions of Mr.Ruchir Bhatia. \n15. The scope of jurisdiction in Section 260A is very well settl ed. It is a \nsettled proposition that ITAT is the final arbiter of the fact s.  High \nCourt can interfere in the order of the ITAT only if there is sub stantial \nquestion of law or there is manifest illegality or it suffers fr om \nperversity.  The general rule is that High Court should be sl ow in \ninterfering into the findings of ITAT, unless it suffers from an y of the \ngrounds mentioned hereinabove. \n16. It is pertinent to mention here that the tribunal had also dis missed the \ncross objections of the assessee in regard to confirmation of certain  \naddition made by the CIT (A).  It is a matter of record that the asses see \nhad not challenged the dismissal of the cross objections. \nDigitally Signed By:RAJ\nBALA\nSigning Date:02.05.2022\n18:58:17Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 129/2022 Page 5 of 7 17. The ITAT in his impugned order has examined the issue raised by the \nappellant thread bear. \n18. The tribunal had gone into the findings of the Assessing Officer and t he \nCIT (A).  The ITAT has dealt with the challenge of the department in  \nregard to the issue raised as follows: \n9. Now coming to the addition u/S 68 of the Act, learned AO recorded \nthat in the bank account of the assesee, an amount of Rs.5 ,05,90,000/- \nwas found credited and that the assessee had filed the c ash flow \nstatement for the year under consideration and also for e arlier years,  \nSince no proof in support of various cash receipts was filed, such cash  \nflow statements remain self serving document and no relia nce could \nbe placed.  On this premise, learned AO proceeded to make the \naddition. \n10. In appellant proceedings, learned CIT (A) looked into th e \ncontentions of the assessee and also found that besides  the opening \ncash in hand, the assessee received Rs.2.05 crores from M/s Vivek \nCommodities, Rs.2.65 crores from M/s Mittal Tin Container I ndustry, \nRs.1,30,500/- from M/s Triveni Infrastructure Development C ompany \nLtd. (TIDCO) and Rs.75 lacs from M/s Triveni Motors.  Out of the \nfour entities, the assessee is the promoter director of TIDCO and \nTriveni Motors, which entities are assessed by the very same AO \nhaving PAN AACCT3870A and AACFT0256B.  Further, learned CIT \n(A) on a perusal of the financial accounts of TIDCO and Trive ni \nMotors noticed that the TIDCO had shareholders fund of Rs .46.57 \ncrores and loan funds to the tune of Rs.47.04 crore and Tri veni \nMotors had a capital of Rs.2.89 crores and loan funds of Rs.5.35 \ncrores.  He, therefore, held that the identity, creditworthin ess and \ngenuineness of M/s TIDCO and M/s Triveni Motors is above an y \nsuspicion. \n11.  In respect of the other two entities, namely, M/s Vivek \nCommodities and M/s Mittal Infrastructure Tin Containers Ltd., \nlearned CIT (A) perused the copies of the income-tax retur n, balance \nsheet and profit and loss account, confirmation of acco unts etc.  It \nwas submitted before the learned CIT (A) that the amounts f rom these \ntwo entities were received on account of pledging some of th e shares \nof TIDCO, which were owned by the assessee pursuant to the s hare \nDigitally Signed By:RAJ\nBALA\nSigning Date:02.05.2022\n18:58:17Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 129/2022 Page 6 of 7 purchase agreement entered with those entities in view of the fa ct that \nthe TIDCO was likely to come up with an IPO at a price band hi gher \nthan the 20% of the present value agreed upon.  Basing on this, \nlearned CIT (A) accepted the genuineness of the transaction wit h \nthese two entities. \n12.  Besides this, learned CIT (A) had taken pains to scruitini ze the \nincome-tax returns and profit and loss account of thes e two entities, \nnamely, M/s Vivek Commodities and M/s Mittal Infrastructu re Tin \nContainers Ltd. and found that both the partnership fir ms had shown \nnil income and there has been no actitivity worthwhile undert aken by \nthem to show any profit earning apparatus.  He further found t hat M/s \nVivek Commodities with 17 partners and the capital of Rs.2 .625 \ncrores raised during the relevant previous year out of which they have \npaid a sum of Rs.2.05 crores to the assessee for purchasing the s hares \nof TIDCO.  Similarly, M/s Mittal Infrastructure Tin Container s Ltd. \nwith 20 partners raised a capital of Rs.2.64 crores dur ing the year \nand paid a sum of Rs.2.65 crores to the assessee for purcha se of \nshares.  On this, learned CIT (A) directed the assessee to pro ve the \nidentity and creditworthiness of all the partners of th ese entities, in \nresponse to which the assessee submitted copies of return o f income, \ncomputation sheet and balance sheet for each of the partn ers.  Since \nthese documents were submitted before the learned CIT (A) and were \nnot available before the learned AO, learned CIT (A) transmit ted the \ndocuments to the learned AO calling upon him to submit  the report. \nLearned CIT (A) recorded that in spite of three reminders, the re was \nno response from the learned AO. In those circumstances, learne d \nCIT (A) in order to ascertain the authenticity of the return  of income, \nidentity and creditworthiness of each of the partners addr essed   and \na letter to the Directorate of Income Tax (systems) and obtai ned the \nreport. On analysis of the return and documents, learned CIT (A ) \nfound that out of the 17 partners of M/s Vivek Commodite s, the \ncreditworthiness of one Harveer Singh was doubtful, as su ch the \nlearned CIT (A) confirmed his contribution to an extent of  \nRs.2,62,500/- \n13.

The Appellant, Revenue, has impugned order dated 23rdAugust, 2018,\npassed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (‘ITAT’) in ITA No.\n1906/Del/2014 for the Assessment Year (‘AY’) 2009-10, in ITA No.\n892/2019.\n1.1. The Revenue, has impugned order dated 9thApril, 2019, passed by the\nITAT in ITA No. 85/Del/2015 for the AY 2010-11 in ITA No. 133/2022.\n2. The Assessee filed its Return of Income (‘ROI’) for AY 2009-10, on\n30thSeptember, 2009, declaring loss of Rs. 8,70,19,143/-. The Assessee’s\nreturn was processed under Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961\n(‘the Act’), and its case was selected for scrutiny assessment, wherei n the\nAssessing Officer (‘AO’) observed that the Assessee Company had entered\ninto international transactions with its Associated Enterprises (AEs). T he\nAO consequently, made a reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer (‘TPO’ )\nDigitally Signed By:PRAMOD\nKUMAR VATS\nSigning Date:18.11.2022\n21:25:03Signature Not Verified\nITA 133/2022 &ITA Nos. 892/2019 Page 3 of 10for determining the Arms’s Length Price (‘ALP’) of the international\ntransactions under Section 92CA(3) of the Act.\n2.1. The TPO in its order dated 29thJanuary, 2013, observed that the\nAssessee has incurred huge Advertising, Marketing and Promotion (‘AMP ’)\nexpenditure with the objective of expanding the reach of the AE’s brand in\nIndia, who is the legal owner of the brand. The TPO then proceeded to apply\nthe Bright Line Test (‘BLT’) method and made an adjustment of Rs.\n6,64,70,841/- on account of AMP expenditure incurred by the Assessee, and\nheld it to be an international transaction. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the AO\npassed its draft assessment order under Section 144C of the Act.\n2.2. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid adjustment made by the TPO on\naccount of AMP expenditure, the Assessee filed its objection before the\nDispute Resolution Panel (‘DRP’). The DRP vide its order dated 26th\nDecember, 2013, disposed of the Assessee’s objection and confirmed the\nadjustment made by the TPO on account of AMP expenditure, by relying on\nthe decision rendered by the special bench of the ITAT in LG Electronics\nIndia Pvt. Ltd. v. ACIT, (2013) 140 ITD 41 (Del) .\n2.3. Pursuant, to the DRP directions, the AO passed its final assessment\norder dated 29thJanuary, 2014, under Section 143(3) read with 144C(1) of\nthe Act, determining the total loss at Rs. 2,05,48,300/- after making an\nadjustment of Rs. 6,64,70,841/- on account of AMP expenditure incurred by\nthe Assessee.\n2.4.

The ITAT concluded that there is no material on the record to\nsuggest there was ‘an arrangement, understanding or action in concert’\nbetween the Assessee and its AE, with respect to the expenditure incurred by\nthe Assessee and was of the opinion that the said expenditure was in nature\nof bonafide business expenditure in furtherance of its legitimate business\ninterest. The ITAT further held that there was no legally sustainable basis or\nmaterial brought on record for the TPO to arrive at the conclusion that there\nwas an international transaction, other than the fact that the TPO has ap plied\nBLT method to reach the aforesaid conclusion. Further, the ITAT held th at\nsince the BLT method has already been negatived by this Court in Sony\nEricsson Mobile Communications India (P.) Ltd. v. Commissioner of\nIncome Tax – III, (2015) 374 ITR 118 (Del), there is no reason to remit the\nmatter back to the TPO, as prayed for by the Revenue .\n3. The facts giving rise to the controversy in the AY 2010-11 are similar\nto that of AY 2009-10 with respect to the ALP adjustment of AMP\nexpenditure. The ITAT in AY 2010-11, held that the issue of absence of\ninternational transaction already stands decided in favour of the Asses see by\nits predecessor bench in AY 2009-10. The ITAT relied on the decision of\nthis Court in Sony Ericsson (Supra) and Maruti Suzuki vs. CIT, [2016] 381\nITR 117, to hold that the Revenue has failed to discharge the onus to prove\nthe existence of an international transaction between the Assessee and its AE\nand held that there doesn’t exist any cogent material to treat the AMP\nexpenditure as international transaction. ITAT vide its impugned order\ndated 9thApril, 2019, allowed the appeal filed by the Assessee and deleted\nDigitally Signed By:PRAMOD\nKUMAR VATS\nSigning Date:18.11.2022\n21:25:03Signature Not Verified\nITA 133/2022 &ITA Nos. 892/2019 Page 5 of 10the adjustment of Rs. 712,19,145/- made on account of AMP expenditure\nincurred by the Assessee.\n4. The learned senior standing counsel for the Revenue states that the\nITAT erred in holding that the AMP expenses is not an international\ntransaction and in doing so it ignored the nature and purpose of such\nexpenses which are meant to create intangible asset for its AE in India. He\nstates that the ITAT erred in holding that the AMP expenses incurred by the\nAssessee is not a separate international transaction.\n5. He states that ITAT failed to appreciate that in the case of Sony\nEricsson (Supra) this Court has held that there exists an international\ntransaction between the assessee therein, who was a ‘distributor’, and i ts\nAE. He states that the facts of this case are similar since the Assesee h erein\nas well is a ‘distributor’ for its AE.\n6. He states that the ITAT erred in not following the decision of this\nCourt in the case of Sony Ericsson (Supra) with respect to remand to the\nTPO for fresh determination of the ALP.\n7. He further states that since the Respondent, Assessee, is admittedl y\nnot the ‘manufacturer’ of the goods and is merely a ‘distributor’ for its A E,\nthe judgements in the case of Bausch & Lomb Eyecare Pvt. Ltd. vs.\nAdditional Commissioner of Income Tax, [2016] 381 ITR 227 and Maruti\nSuzuki (Supra) ,cannot be relied upon. He states that since in the case of\nMaruti Suzuki (Supra) and Bausch & Lomb (Supra) ,the Assessee therein\nwas a manufacturer as well as the seller of the goods and it was in these\nspecific facts that the Court held that the expenditure incurred by the\nAssessee therein for advertisement and promotion was for its own benefit.\nDigitally Signed By:PRAMOD\nKUMAR VATS\nSigning Date:18.11.2022\n21:25:03Signature Not Verified\nITA 133/2022 &ITA Nos. 892/2019 Page 6 of 108. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. It is admitted on\nrecord that the contention of the Revenue that there exists an internat ional\ntransaction between the Assessee and its AE, is not based on any agreement\nexecuted between the said parties. The sole basis for making this adjustment\nwas a presumption drawn by the TPO that huge AMP expenditure was\nincurred by the Assessee to expand the reach of its AE’s brand in India. The\nrelevant finding of the TPO in its order for AY 2009-10 read as under:\n“4.1 It is seen that the assessee has incurred an extremely high\nlevel of advertising and market promotion (AMP) expenditure. In\nsuch cases there is a possibility that the objective of the heightened\nlevel of AMP expenditure is to expand the reach of the AE's brand\nin India. The AE is the legal owner of the brand. Therefore the\nbeneficiary of the efforts of the assessee is the AE as the brand\nvalue increases significantly given the efforts of the assessee. The\nassessee is thereby creating marketing intangible in favour of the\nAE…”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\nIt is evident from the aforesaid that the TPO has determined the\nexistence of an international transaction on a matter of a presumption, which\nruns counter to the decision of this Court in Maruti Suzuki (supra ).\n9. The ITAT while allowing the Assessee’s appeal for AY 2009-10 has\nafter considering the material on record held that there was no internati onal\ntransaction between the Assessee and its AE. The relevant findings of the\nITAT are as under: -\n“9.

It was only on the basis of\nbright line test that the impugned ALP adjustment was made but\nthat approach has already been negatived by Hon'ble Courts above.\nWe see no reasons to remit the matter to the file of the TPO, as is\nprayed for by the learned Departmental Representative. A remand\nto the assessment stage cannot be a matter of routine; it has to be\nso done only when there is anything in the facts and circumstances\nto so warrant or justify. In any case, there are direct judicial\nprecedents from Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court which clearly\nsuggest that the matter regarding existence of international\ntransaction under section 92B, as far as possible, should be decided\nat the level of Tribunal itself…\nxxx xxx xxx\n10. In the present case, no new facts have emerged and all the facts\nbrought to record, during the course of the assessment proceedings,\ndo not indicate legally sustainable basis for coming to the\nconclusion that there was an internal transaction in respect of AMP\nexpenses incurred by the assessee. We are, therefore, of the\nconsidered view that the plea of the assessee, on the peculiar facts\nof this case, does indeed deserve to be upheld that there is no\nmaterial on record to hold that there was an international\ntransactions, in terms of the provisions of Section 92B, nor any\nmaterial has been brought on record to even remotely suggest so\nand, therefore, that there is no good reason to remit the matter to\nthe assessment stage for building a case afresh.

The plea of the learned counsel was indeed well taken and\nmerits acceptance. The impugned ALP adjustment of Rs\n6,64,70,841, accordingly, stands deleted.”\n10. The Revenue has not brought on record any material to assail the\naforesaid finding of the ITAT as regards the absence of any internationa l\ntransaction.\n11. In similar facts, the Court in Maruti Suzuki (supra) set aside the order\nof the TPO/AO, which had determined the AMP expenditure as an\ninternational transaction, without any evidence on record and only on the\nbasis of BLT. The relevant findings of this Court are as under:\n“65.The transfer pricing adjustment is not expected to be made by\ndeducing from the difference between the ‘excessive’ AMP\nexpenditure incurred by the Assessee and the AMP expenditure of a\ncomparable entity that an international transaction exists and then\nproceed to make the adjustment of the difference in order to\ndetermine the value of such AMP expenditure incurred for the AE.\nAnd, yet, that is what appears to have been done by the Revenue in\nthe present case. It first arrived at the ‘bright line’ by comparing\nthe AMP expenses incurred by MSIL with the average percentage\nof the AMP expenses incurred by the comparable entities. Since on\napplying the BLT, the AMP spend of MSIL was found ‘excessive’\nthe Revenue deduced the existence of an international transaction.\nIt then added back the excess expenditure as the transfer pricing\n‘adjustment’. This runs counter to legal position explained in CIT v.\nEKL Appliances Ltd. (2012) 345 ITR 241 (Del), which required a\nTPO “to examine the ‘international transaction’ as he actually\nfinds the same.” In other words the very existence of an\ninternational transaction cannot be a matter for inference or\nsurmise.\n66.As already noticed, the decision in Sony Ericsson has done\naway with the BLT as means for determining the ALP of an\nDigitally Signed By:PRAMOD\nKUMAR VATS\nSigning Date:18.11.2022\n21:25:03Signature Not Verified\nITA 133/2022 &ITA Nos. 892/2019 Page 9 of 10international transaction involving AMP expenses.…”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n12. We are unable to agree with the contention of the learned counsel for\nthe Revenue that in the facts of the present appeal(s), the matter should be\nremanded to TPO in terms of Sony Ericsson (Supra). He states that in the\nsaid decision this Court held that there exists an international transaction\nbetween the Assessee therein, who was a ‘distributor’, and its AE. We are\nunable to accept the said contention of the learned counsel for the Revenue\nthat since the Assessee herein is a ‘distributor’ for its AE, the corollary of\nthis fact is that there exists an",

No. 9598/2020 filed by the appellants\ninfructuous.\n5. Per contra , learned counsel for the respondent, who appears on\nadvance notice, states that the order dated 5thAugust, 2020 whereby the ad-\ninterim injunction was granted in favour of the Respondent, quotes para 19\nof the plaint (that was amended vide the amendment application) and it\nmentions the plaintiff’s trademarks. He states that even if the three\ntrademarks that were mistakenly stated to be registered in the plaint are not\nconsidered, the Respondent-Plaintiff has three other trademarks registered in\nits favour.\n6. In rejoinder, learned counsel for the appellant states that out of three\nmarks wrongly mentioned, two are associate marks and the other is a\nrepetition.\n7. This Court is of the view that the impugned order insofar as it allows\nthe amendment application is legally sound, inasmuch as, it follows the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal vs. K.K. Modi,\n(2006) 4 SCC 385 and Revajeetu Builders and Developers vs.\nNarayanaswamy and Sons and Ors., MANU/SC/1724/2009.\n8. However, to balance the equities, this Court directs that when the\nlearned Single Judge considers the perjury application as well as application\nfor vacation of stay, the plea that the initial plaint contained details of three\nadditional registrations out of which one was repetition shall be considered\nfor what it is worth. The rights and contentions of all the parties are left\nopen.\nDigitally Signed By:JASWANT\nSINGH RAWAT\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n18:49:22Signature Not Verified\nNeutral Citation Number: 2023:DHC:2020-DB\nFAO(OS)(COMM) 50/2022 Page 4 of 49.

In brief, the facts of the case are that Pitesh @ Hitesh along with Nand \nlal and Rajeev Kumar were coming from Manesar towards Delhi by truck  \nbearing No.  DL IM 4988, being driven by Rajeev Kumar. When they arrived \nat Atlas Chowk in Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon, another truck, bearing  the \nnumber HR 55J 2806, which was travelling ahead of their vehicle, su ddenly \nstopped due to failure of excels. Subsequently, the victim's truc k collided \nwith the said truck. Thereafter another truck i.e. offending veh icle bearing \nnumber HR 38 S 9138 suddenly arrived from the IFFCO chowk, Gurgaon  \nside at very high speed and was driven in a rash and negligen t manner, hit \nthe above-mentioned victim's truck DL IM 4988 from the back si de. As a \nresult, Pitesh @ Hitesh and Rajiv Kumar sustained injuries w ere taken to the \nhospital, where Pitesh @ Hitesh was declared brought dead and R ajeev \nKumar sustained injuries. \n3.

It is submitted by learned counsel appearing for the appell ants that \nlearned Tribunal has erred in considering the deceased as an unsk illed   \nperson while granting the compensation. It is further submit ted that learned \nTribunal has ignored the fact that deceased had completed class 1 0th and \ncould not be characterised as unskilled.

It is submitted by the counsel for the injured appellan t that the learned \nTribunal erred in determining the injured appellant's monthly income at Rs. \n8,554/- by classifying him as unskilled. It is further subm itted that the \nappellant (injured) was earning Rs.14,000/- per month as salary an d was \ngetting Rs.4000/- per month extra for food and other miscellaneo us \nexpenses. It is further submitted that the appellant (injured ) is a matriculate \ndriver who had a significant amount of experience, so he cannot be deemed \nunskilled. It is further submitted that the appellant (inju red) has lost his left \nhand and sustained 80% permanent disability due to which he could not do \nany type of work in future and learned Tribunal has awarded a sum  which is \non lesser side.  It is further submitted that appellant (inju red) was 24 years \nold at the time of the accident and has a family to support.   \n6. On the other hand, it is submitted by learned counsel f or the \nrespondent no. 1 – Insurance Company that learned Tribunal has rightly \npassed the Award and there is no error in granting the compensa tion, \nhowever, the learned Tribunal has granted the compensation on t he higher \nside. It is further submitted that appellants/claimants did n ot bring any \ndocument to show that the deceased was Class 10th passed and the only \ndocument which was produced before this Court was school lea ving \ncertificate.

In these connected appeals, a bare perusal of the impugned A ward \ndated 03.10.2018 shows that the learned Tribunal has dealt with each and \nevery issue in great detail.  As far as the contention of the learned counsl for \nthe appellants with regard to the deceased being skilled is concerned, no \ndocument was produced either before the learned Tribunal or before this  \nCourt and mere school leaving certificate, produced before this Co urt, is not \nsufficient to prove that the deceased was Class 10th pass and can be \nconsidered as skilled.  I have also perused the observations made by the \nlearned Tribunal with respect to the income of the deceased an d the injured \nwhich reads as under:- \n “In the instant case, it is being submitted on behalf of the \npetitioners that at the time of the accident, deceased Pit esh @ Hitesh \nwas working as conductor and was earning Rs.10,000/- pm, however \nno evidence, documentary or otherwise, regarding the said \nemployment or income of the deceased have been bought by the \npetitioner and in absence, thereof, the minimum wages prescri bed \nduring the relevant period, i.e Rs. 8,554/-p.m is taken as criteria for \ncalculating the loss of dependency in the instant case. ”  \nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \n29.

Therefore, this contention of the learne d counsel \nfor the appellants has no force in it and is hereby rejected.  \n8. As far as the contention of the learned counsel for the appel lant with \nregard to appellant (injured) losing his left hand and permanen t disability of \n80% is concerned, the learned Tribunal has granted further compens ation \napart from the awarded amount for implantation of artificial li mb, the \nrelevant portion reads as follows:- \n “37.

Admittedly, at the time of the alleged incident deceased and the \ninjured were travelling in a truck bearing No. DL-1M4988. Bot h the parties, \nduring the trial, have produced the witnesses in support of their respective \ncase and learned Tribunal has thoroughly analyzed the statemen ts of the \nwitnesses.  \n10. In the case of ‘K. Suresh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. ’ reported \nin (2012) 12 SCC 274,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India while observing \nthat Tribunal and Courts have to be broad based in compu ting compensation \nhas held as under:- \n “10. It is noteworthy to stat e that an adjudicating authority, \nwhile determining the quantum of compensation, has to ke ep in view \nthe sufferings of the injured person which would include his inability \nto lead a full life, his incapacity to enjoy the normal a menities which \nhe would have enjoyed but for the injuries and his abi lity to earn as \nmuch as he used to earn or could have earned. Hence, while \ncomputing compensation the approach of the Tribunal or a court \nhas to be broad-based. Needless to say, it would involve some \nguesswork as there cannot be any mathematical exactitude or a  \nprecise formula to determine the quantum of compensation.  In \ndetermination of compensation the fundamental criterion is of “just \ncompensation” should be in heard.  \nDigitally Signed By:KAMAL\nKANT MENDIRATTA\nSigning Date:25.05.2023\n15:07:40Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023:DHC:3669 \n \n \nMAC.

Looking into the entire circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that \nquantum of compensation granted by learned Tribunal is just and proper and \nhas been granted in terms of assertions made by Hon’ble Supreme Court in \nvarious judicial precedents.  \n12.

In the period in issue, 1/5th of the aforementioned amount i.e., \n9,46,22,358/- was claimed as an expense. In absolute terms, the amount \nclaimed as deduction in AY 2011-12 by the respondent/asses see was Rs. \n1,89,24,471/-. \n6. The appellant/revenue also sought to deny the deduction to  the \nrespondent/assessee on the ground that the issue of shares to QIB was not a \n“public subscription ”.   \n7. Given the fact that in the period in issue i.e., AY 2011-12, the expense \nclaimed was only Rs.1,89,24,472/-, in our opinion, the tax effect  would be \nless than the prescribed threshold i.e., Rs. 1 crore.   \n8. Given this position, the appeal is closed with liber ty to the \nappellant/revenue to approach the court, for revival of the appeal, if they \nreceive instructions to the contrary.   \n8.1 We have noteed this aspect Mr Sanjay Kumar, learned senior standin g \ncounsel, has been unable to obtain instructions from the con cerned  \nAssessment Officer (AO) despite the opportunity. \n \n \nRAJIV SHAKDHER, J  \n \nGIRISH KATHPALIA, J  \n DECEMBER 7, 2023 / tr \n \n \nDigitally Signed By:ATUL\nJAIN\nSigning Date:15.12.2023\n11:53:03Signature Not Verified",

In other words, it is not clear whether the Assessing Officer (AO) \nintended to levy a penalty on the respondent/assessee for concealment of \nparticulars of his income, or furnishing inaccurate particulars.  This issue is \ncovered against the appellant/revenue in a catena of judgments, including \nthe judgment rendered by the coordinate bench in the matter of Pr. \nCommissioner of Income Tax-3 v. Ms Minu Bakshi .  2022:DHC:2814-DB.  \n4.1 The relevant observations made in the said judgment are extracted \nhereafter: \n \n“7. In our opinion, the conclusion reached by the Tribunal \nin the instant case that the notice for imposition of penalty \nunder Section 271(1) (c) of the Act, did not specify which \nlimb of the said provision the penalty was sought to be \nlevied, is covered by the following decisions, which includes \na decision rendered by a coordinate bench of this Court.  \n(i) CIT and Anr. v M/s SS A’s Emerald Meadows, passed in \nITA No. 380/2015, dated 23.11.2015.  \n(ii) Commissioner of Income Tax v Manjunatha Cotton and \nGinning Factory (2013) 359 ITR 565 (Kar.)  \n(iii) PCIT vs M/s Sahara India Life Insurance Company \nLtd., passed in ITA No.475/2019, dated 02.08.2019.  \n7.1. To be noted, the Special Leave Petition filed against the \njudgement in SSA’s Emerald (mentioned above) was \ndismissed via order dated 05.08.2016. \n7.2. We are in agreement with the view taken by the \nKarnataka High Court in the above-mentioned judgements \n(in SSA’s Emerald and Manjunatha Cotton) and, in any \nevent, are bound by the view taken by the coordinate bench \nof this court in the Sahara India case. ” \n \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ATUL JAIN\nSigning Date:27.08.2023\n22:34:59Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.189-192/2023                                                                                                            Page 3 of 4  \n 5. This view has also been followed by this court in Pr. Commissioner \nof Income Tax, Delhi-7 v. Unitech Reliable Projects Pvt. Ltd. , \n2023:DHC:4258-DB.  \n5.1 The following observations made in the PCIT v. Unitech Reliable \nProjects Ltd.  case, being relevant insofar as this case is concerned, are \nextracted hereafter: \n \n“19. We may note, that even the assessment order dated \n14.03.2015, whereby penalty proceedings were triggered, \ndid not indicate as to which limb of Section 271(1)(c) was \nbeing triggered qua the petitioner. This is evident from the \nfollowing observation made by the AO: “Penalty \nproceeding u/s 271(1)(c) is being initiated separately for \nconcealment of income & for furnishing inaccurate \nparticulars of income.”  \n \n20. We may note, that another coordinate bench of this \nCourt, of which one of us [i.e., Rajiv Shakdher, J.] was a \nparty has reached the same conclusion in PCIT vs. Minu \nBakshi 222 (7) TMI 1370-Delhi. 21. Penalty proceedings \nentail civil consequences for the assessee. The AO is \nrequired to apply his mind to the material particulars, and \nindicate clearly, as to what is being put against the \nrespondent/assessee when triggering the penalty \nproceedings.  \n \n21. Penalty proceedings entail civil consequences for the \nassessee. The AO is required to apply his mind to the \nmaterial particulars, and indicate clearly, as to what is \nbeing put against the respondent/assessee when triggering \nthe penalty proceedings. \n \n22. In case the AO concludes, that a case is made out under \nSection 271(1)(c) of the Act, he needs to indicate, clearly, as \nto which limb of the said provision is attracted. The reason \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ATUL JAIN\nSigning Date:27.08.2023\n22:34:59Signature Not Verified\n \nITA Nos.189-192/2023                                                                                                            Page 4 of 4  \n we say so is, that apart from anything else, the pecuniary \nburden may vary, depending on the infraction(s) committed \nby the respondent/assessee. In a given case, where \nconcealment has taken place, a heavier burden may be \nimposed, than in a situation where an assessee is involved \nin furnishing inaccurate particulars. ” \n \n23. Therefore, it is necessary for the AO to indicate, \nbroadly, as to the provision/limb under which penalty \nproceedings are triggered against the assessee. \n[Emphasis is ours] \n \n6. In view of the foregoing, we are not inclined to admit these appeals, \nas according to us, no substantial question of law arises for our \nconsideration.   \n7. Accordingly, the appeals are closed.   \n  \n \nRAJIV SHAKDHER, J  \n \nGIRISH KATHPALIA, J  \n AUGUST 18, 2023 / tr \n \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ATUL JAIN\nSigning Date:27.08.2023\n22:34:59Signature Not Verified",

Page 3 of 4 \n “Tribunal”].  \n4.1 The Tribunal, by way of a brief order, has remitted the matter to  the \nTransfer Pricing Officer (TPO) with a direction to decide the issues afres h, \nafter consideration of the evidence filed by the assessee. \n5. Furthermore, the TPO has been directed to give a hearing in the \nmatter to the authorized representative of the assessee. The directi on for \nremand was prefaced with the Tribunal invoking Rule 29 of the Inc ome Tax \nAppellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 [in short, “Rules”] . Accordingly, in exercise \nof the power vested under the said Rule, additional supporting  evidence was \nadmitted by the Tribunal, with a view that it required appraisal by the TPO. \n5.1 It also appears that, while exercising its power to remit t he matter to \nthe TPO, the Tribunal took into account the fact that the issues  which had \nbeen raised on merits before it, obtained in earlier assessment years as well, \nin which, no objection was raised or disallowance ordered by t he Assessing \nOfficer (AO)/TPO.  \n6. Thus, having regard to the fact that the assessee was under a bona fide  \nbelief, in view of similarity of issues, that it need not file d ocumentary \nevidence, the Tribunal, as noted above, remitted the matter to the TPO.  \n7. We have looked at the record, with the assistance of Mr Zoheb \nHossain, who appears on behalf of the appellant/revenue.  \n8. Mr Hossain, cannot but accept that the matter may require further \nexamination by the TPO, notwithstanding the fact that the impugne d order is \nrather cryptic.  \n9. In our view, no prejudice will be caused to either side if the m atter is \nremitted to the TPO, as directed by the Tribunal.  \n10.

It is submitted in the application that due to the demis e of some of the \nparties during the pendency of the suit, the sahams/ shares of t he surviving \nparties/ legal representatives/heirs of the deceased who are alr eady party on \nrecord have changed.  Hence, the plaintiff seeks to amendment the plai nt by \nadding paragraph 9A to 9F describing the shares of the various  parties to the \npresent suit.  \n3. Further, the value of the properties as referred to in paragra ph 13, 14 \nand 15 and in Exhibit 1, 2 and 3 which are  the subject matter of the partition \nin this suit, was based on Government/Tax Authorities v aluation/estimates \ndone much prior to the date of filing of the plaint.  The plai ntiff verily \nbelieves that the market value of the properties in the Exhibi ts 1, 2 and 3 \ntaken together at the time of filing of the plaint was Rs.25 crore.  Hence, the \nplaintiff seeks permission to amend paragraph 22 to amend the suit valuation  \nas Rs.25 crores with the share of the plaintiff on partition  est imated as \nRs.1,01,27,315/- on which the court fee has already been paid.   \n4. It is submitted that these amendments are necessary for determin ing \nthe real question in controversy between the parties and these are also \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 3 of 20 \n expedient in view of the pendency of the suit for 50 years before this Court.  \nThis suit has been taken up for final arguments on number o f occasions, but \nbecause of pendency of appeals arising out of another suit for partition of \nimmovable and movable properties located in Rampur, U.P. between t he \nsame parties, the hearing of the present suit has been deferred.  The decision \nof the Supreme Court has been delivered on 21st July, 2019 in 'Talat Fatima \nHasan v. Syed Murtaza Ali Khan (D) by LRs and Others (2020) 15 SCC \n655'.   \n5. It is further asserted that during the pendency of the appeals before the \nSupreme Court, the contesting defendants had filed a Transfer petition in the \nSupreme Court seeking transfer of this case to Supreme Court.  However, \nthe said petition was rejected.   \n6. It is claimed that in case the amendments are not allowed, the  plaintiff \nwould suffer irreparable loss and would be prejudiced beyond res titution \nwhile no prejudice shall be caused to the other parties.  A prayer is, \ntherefore, made that the amendment of the paragraphs as stated above, m ay \nbe allowed. \n7. The application is contested by  defendant No.1(iv) who in his \ndetailed reply  has asserted that all the averments made in the application \nare traversed and specifically denied except those which are admit ted \nexpressly.  It is claimed that the application is malafide, misconcei ved and \nmisguided and is a gross abuse of the process of law.   \n8. The first plea taken to oppose the proposed amendments is that they \nare barred by limitation.  It is claimed that the proposed insertions are based \non the basis of demise of parties from time to time  and inclu sion of legal \nheirs as well as change of their shares on account of demise. The cause of  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 4 of 20 \n action for effecting these changes first arose on 07th February, 1982 and last \non 03rd August, 1993.  Despite having impleaded the legal heirs, t he plaintiff \nfailed to seek corresponding changes in the shares of the partie s by way of \namendment of the plaint.  No reason has been given for filin g this \napplication after a delay of almost 30-40 years.  The proposed amendments \nare, therefore, liable to be rejected. The proposed amendments are also  \nhopelessly barred by time.   \n9. Likewise, it is asserted that the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court \nwas varied by Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015 read with \nNotification No.  27187/DHC/Orgl. dated 24th November, 2015 whereby all \nCivil suits having a valuation of less than Rs. 2 crores were required to be \ntransferred to jurisdictional subordinate Courts. The instant  amendment \nshould have been preferred within three years of the said Notificati on but it \nhas been filed only in 2022 i.e. after about seven years and is , therefore, \nbarred by limitation. \n10. It is further submitted that the suit involves movable property i.e. \njewellery which is contained in three lists annexed along wit h the plaint and \nare described in paragraph 13 to 15 of the plaint.  There is n o other property \nwhich is the subject matter of the suit.  A bare perusal of paragraph  13 to 15 \nwould show that the properties dealt therein were valued at Rs .5 lakhs, \nRs.10 lakhs and Rs.85 lakhs respectively.  The sum total of all  the movable \nproperties is Rs.1 crore at which the suit was originally valu ed as is \nmentioned in paragraph 22 of the plaint. The plaintiff now st ates that the \nactual value of the property at the time of institution of the  suit was Rs 25 \ncrores.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 5 of 20 \n 11. This is contrary to the averments made in a similar applicati on \nbearing I.A.5863/2022 seeking same amendment which was filed earlier \n(but withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application) wherein the plaintiff \nhad contended that now the value of the suit property has appreciated and is \nworth Rs.25 crores.  The plaintiff, therefore, himself had asserted t hat the \npresent value of the property is Rs.25 crores.  After realizing th at the earlier \nstand may be futile, the plaintiff has now come up with a new  and a \ncompletely contrary case that the value of the suit property at the time of \nfiling of the suit was Rs.25 crores, which cannot be permitted. The proposed \namendment in regard to valuation of the property is against the very contents \nof the plaint.  Furthermore, it is not permissible to take inc onsistent pleas in \nthe plaint and the amendment application is liable to be dismissed.   \n12. It is further asserted that the amendments under Order VI rule 17 CPC \ncan be allowed only if they are necessary for determination of real qu estions \nin controversy between the parties.  Vide Order dated 24th August, 1978, \nfollowing issues were framed for trial: \n\"1. Whether the properties mentioned in the Schedule \nannexed to the Plaint were the properties of late Major \nGeneral Sir Saiyed Raza Ali Khan  Bahadur at the time \nof his death? (OPP). \n2. If issue no. 1 is proved, what are the respective \nshares of the parties to the suit? \n3. Whether the suit is within time? \n4. Relief. \"  \n \n13. The question of valuation of the suit was not in issue.  The plaintiff \nhas miserably failed to aver, much less to demonstrate, how th e valuation of \nthe subject property is a real question in controversy in th e present case.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 6 of 20 \n The application, therefore, deserves to be dismissed as it fails to meet the \nrequirements of Order VI Rule 17 CPC.  \n14. Furthermore, the proviso to Order VI Rule 17 CPC clearly pr ovides \nthat  application for amendment can be allowed after the commencement  of \ntrial only if the plaintiff is able to demonstrate due diligence.  Again, this is \nconspicuously not mentioned in the application and the trial got concluded \nseveral decades ago. Hence, there is no reason for allowing the amend ment \napplication.  \n15. It is further submitted that in the case of Subhashini Malik vs. \nS.K.Gandhi (2016) 233 DLT83 this Court had noted that amendments to the \nplaint are usually retrospective and relate back to the date of o riginal filing.  \nAssuming but not conceding that the amendment is permitted  in the present \ncase, it would have the effect of enhancing the suit valuation for the purpose \nof institution of the suit.  Clearly, this cannot be done, once there is no \ndispute in regard to the valuation of the suit property.  Reference has also \nbeen made to the observations of Madras High Court in SI Bullah Khan vs. \nHairunisha Beevi & Ors.  2016-4-LW-430 which held that the amendments \nwould relate back to the date of institution of the suit.   \n16. On merits,  all the averrments made in the application are denied and \nit is claimed that the application is liable to be dismissed. \n17. Submissions heard . \n \nA.  Proposed amendment is barred by Limitation: \n18. Before considering the application on merits, it would be per tinent to \nrefer to first consider the objection taken at the outset on beha lf of the \ndefendant about the proposed amendment being barred by limitatio n.  It is \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 7 of 20 \n claimed that the suit was filed on 20th May, 1972 while the present \napplication has been filed in the year 2022 after about 50 years.  An y \namendment which is allowed to be made in the plaint relates back to the date \nof institution of the suit.  This amendment application is highly belated as it \nis not based on any subsequent events.  Furthermore, if at all the right to \nseek amendment accrued on the Notification of Delhi High Court  dated 24th \nNovember, 2015, whereby the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court  was \nchanged. If the cause of action is deemed to have arisen on accou nt of this \nNotification then too it could have been filed within three years  from the \nNotification but the application has been filed after seven years  and is \nbeyond the period of three years.  It is argued that whichever way this  aspect \nmay be considered, the application of the plaintiff is hopelessly  barred by \nlimitation. \n19. The contention raised on behalf of the defendant appears to be self \ncontradictory.  While on one hand it is claimed that the amend ment if \nallowed, would be effective from the date of institution, on the other hand \nthe same is claimed to be barred by limitation.  If the amendment is \npermitted, then it relates back to the date of institution and there is no \nquestion of the same being barred by limitation.  This is more so because \nessentially the amendment is sought only in respect of the valu ation of the \nsuit property.  It does not touch on the merits of the suit nor does it claim \nany variation in the suit property.  This argument addressed on behalf of the \ndefendant of the proposed amendment being barred by limitation is clearly \nnot tenable under law. \n \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 8 of 20 \n B.  Whether proposed amendment for enhancement of valuation meets the \n tests for allowing the amendments under Order VI Rule 17 CPC. \n20. The rules or procedure as contained in Code of Civil Procedure are  \nonly handmade to justice and any pedantic approach in interpret ing them \nstrictly does not serve the cause of action as has been held  in catena of \njudgments.  The procedural rules cannot be interpreted to defeat the interest \nof justice and must be liberally construed to propagate the dete rmination of \nthe controversy in the suit. To appreciate the scope of the amendment \nproposed by the plaintiff, apropos reference be made to the section itself.  \n Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC as un-amended  reads as under: \n\"Amendment of pleadings.- The Court may at any \nstage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or \namend his pleadings in such manner and on such \nterms as may be just, and all such amendments shall \nbe made as may be necessary for the purpose of \ndetermining the real questions in controversy \nbetween the parties.\"  \n    \n21. It was felt that one major bottleneck to expeditious disposal  of the \nsuits in the Civil Court were frequent filing of application under Order VI \nRule 17 which prompted the legislation in the year 1999 to del ete the \namendment provision as contained in Order VI Rule 17 from the Code of \nCivil Procedure.  However, realizing that the amendment may be warranted  \nfor various reason, it was re-introduced in the year 2002 but with the proviso  \nthat once the trial has commenced, the amendment can be allowed only  if it \ncould not have been done despite exercise of due diligence.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004186\n \nCS(OS) 219/1972                                                                                                                Page 9 of 20 \n 22.

The counsel for the petitioner argued that the Trial Court shou ld \nnot have issued the bailable warrants against the petitioner v ide order \ndated 16.07.2018 as at that time the cognizance of the alleged o ffence \nwas not taken. The counsel for the petitioner also challenged the order \ndated 26.09.2018 on the ground that the Trial Court has ta ken the \ncognizance without specifying the offence for which the cogniz ance \nhas been taken and as such the order dated 26.09.2018 was passed in a \nvery casual and cursory manner and is liable to be set aside. The \ncounsel for the petitioner referred the judgment dated 19.05.2022  \npassed by this Court in Crl. M.C. 4177/2019 titled as Sanjit Bakshi V \nState of NCT of Delhi and Others. The counsel for the respondent \nno. 2 argued that the present petition is liable to be dismissed .  \n9.

In the judgment titled as Mona Panwar V. High Court of \nJudicature of Allahabad (2011) 3 SCC 496 the Supreme Court \nobserved that a Magistrate can under Section 190 of the Code befo re \ntaking cognizance ask for investigation by the police under Sect ion \n156(3) of taking cognizance. If after cognizance has been taken and  \nthe Magistrate want any investigation, it will be under section  202 of \nthe Code.  \n11. A Magistrate is not empowered to summon or secure the \nattendance of the accused before taking cognizance as per the sectio n \n190 of the Code. The chapter XVI of the Code deals with \ncommencement of proceedings before Magistrates. Section 204 of the \nCode deals with the issuance of process Sub section (1) provid es that \nif in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offenc e, there \nis sufficient ground for proceedings and the case appears to be a \nwarrant trial, he may issue a warrant or summon for causing the \nappearance of the accused before the Magistrate. The combined \nreading of the section 190 and 204 of the code reflects that th e \nmagistrate is empowered to secure presence of the accused in warrant \ncase only after taking cognizance of an offence. The order dated \n16.07.2018 is liable to be set aside as the Court was not  competent to \nissue bailable warrants against the petitioner before taking cognizance. \nAccordingly order dated 16.07.2018 is set aside.   \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003233\n \n  \nCRL.M.C. 11/2019                         Page 6 of 9  \n 12. Section 190 of the code empowers a Magistrate to take \ncognizance of an offence in certain circumstances. Sub-section (1) \nreads as under:-  \nCognizance of offences by Magistrates.-1) Subject \nto the provisions of this Chapter, any Magistrate \nof the first class, and any Magistrate of the \nsecond class specially empowered in this behalf \nunder Sub-section (2), may take cognizance of \nany offence- \n(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which \nconstitute such offence; \n(b) upon a police report of such facts; \n(c) upon information received from any person \nother than a police officer, or upon his own \nknowledge, that such offence has been \ncommitted. \n13. This Court in Sanjit Bakshi V State of NCT of Delhi  passed in \nCrl.M.C.4177/2019 dated 19.05.2022 observed that cognizance \nimplies application of judicial mind by the Magistrate to t he facts as \nstated in a complaint or a police report or upon information received \nfrom any person that an offence has been committed. The Court before \ntaking cognizance needs to be satisfied about existence of prim a facie \ncase on basis of material collected after conclusion of investigati on \nand the magistrate has to apply his mind to the facts stated in the \npolice report or complaint before taking cognizance for coming t o the \nconclusion that there is sufficient material to proceed with t he case. \nTaking of cognizance is a judicial function and judicial ord ers cannot \nbe passed in a mechanical or cryptic manner. At time of taking \ncognizance a Magistrate is not required to consider the defence of t he \nproposed accused or to evaluate the merits of the material collect ed \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003233\n \n  \nCRL.M.C. 11/2019                         Page 7 of 9  \n during investigation. The order taking cognizance should on ly reflect \napplication of judicial mind.  \n14. In R.R. Chari V State of Uttar Pradesh,  951CriLJ 775 the \nquestion before the Supreme Court was as to when cognizance of the  \noffence could be said to have been taken by the Magistrate under \nSection 190 of the Code. It was observed as under:-  \nIt is clear from the wording of the section that the initiation \nof the proceedings against a person commences on the \ncognizance of the offence by the Magistrate under one of the \nthree contingencies mentioned in the section. The first \ncontingency evidently is in respect of non-cognizable \noffences as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code on the \ncomplaint of an aggrieved person. The second is on a police \nreport, which evidently is the case of a cognizable offence \nwhen the police have completed their investigation and come \nto the Magistrate for the issue of a process. The third is \nwhen the Magistrate himself takes notice of an offence and \nissues the process. It is important to remember that in \nrespect of any cognizable offence, the police, at the initial \nstage when they are investigating the matter, can arrest a \nperson without obtaining an order from the Magistrate. \nUnder Section 167(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code the \npolice have of course to put up the person so arrested before \na Magistrate within 24 hours and obtain an order of remand \nto police custody for the purpose of further investigation, if \nthey so desire. But they have the power to arrest a person \nfor the purpose of investigation without approaching the \nMagistrate first. Therefore in cases of cognizable offence \nbefore proceedings are initiated and while the matter is \nunder investigation by the police the suspected person is \nliable to be arrested by the police without an order by the \nMagistrate. \n \n15. The Supreme Court in Fakhruddin Ahmad V State of \nUttaranchal , (2008) 17 SCC 157 also held as under:- \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003233\n \n  \nCRL.M.C. 11/2019                         Page 8 of 9  \n Nevertheless, it is well settled that before a Magistrate can \nbe said to have taken cognizance of an offence, it \nis imperative that he must have taken notice of the \naccusations and applied his mind to the allegations made in \nthe complaint or in the police report or the information \nreceived from a source other than a police report, as the case \nmay be, and the material filed therewith. It needs little \nemphasis that it is only when the Magistrate applies his \nmind and is satisfied that the allegations, if proved, would \nconstitute an offence and decides to initiate proceedings \nagainst the alleged offender, that it can be positively stated \nthat he has taken cognizance of the offence. Cognizance is in \nregard to the offence and not the offender.  \n \n16. The Supreme Court also observed in  S.K. Sinha, Chief \nEnforcement Officer V Videocon  International Ltd., (2008) 2 SCC \n492 held as under: - \nThe expression 'cognizance' has not been defined in the \nCode. But the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It \nhas no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law. It \nmerely means 'become aware of' and when used with \nreference to a Court or a Judge, it connotes to take notice of \n„judicially‟. It indicates the point when a Court or a \nMagistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to \ninitiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have \nbeen committed by someone.  \n \n'Taking cognizance' does not involve any formal action of \nany kind. It occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind \nto the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance is \ntaken prior to commencement of criminal proceedings. \nTaking of cognizance is thus a sine qua non or condition \nprecedent for holding a valid trial. Cognizance is taken of an \noffence and not of an offender. Whether or not a Magistrate \nhas taken cognizance of an offence depends on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and no rule of universal \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003233\n \n  \nCRL.M.C. 11/2019                         Page 9 of 9  \n application can be laid down as to when a Magistrate can be \nsaid to have taken cognizance. \n \n17.

Learned Counsel has further submitted that the application wa s also filed \nat a belated stage and therefore in absence of any application for \ncondonation of delay, the ex parte  order could not have been set aside. \n4. Learned Counsel has relied upon the judgments :-    \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003757\n \nC.R.P. 3/2018  Page 2 of 4 i. Satya Infrastructure  Ltd. & Ors. Vs.

It has been submitted that defendants / respondents has miserab ly \nfailed to discharge onus placed on them by satisfactorily \ndemonstrating to the court that it was prevented by a sufficien t cause \nfrom appearing the suit when it was called on for appearing. \n6. I have considered the submissions and perused the record.  The \nrevisional jurisdiction as provided under section 115, CPC i s very \nlimited. In the revisional jurisdiction the court can exercis e its \njurisdiction only if the Sub-ordinate Court appears:  \n(i) To have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law; or \n(ii) To have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or \n (iii) To have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally  or w ith \nmaterial irregularity. \n7. In the present case, the learned Trial Court had recorded the findin g \nthat the summons were duly served upon the respondent on \n16.08.2016 and defendant no. 2 had been appearing with Couns el till \n04.11.2016. \n8. The defendant could not file the written statement till 20.02 .2017 and \ntherefore the opportunity to file written statement was closed and \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003757\n \nC.R.P. 3/2018  Page 3 of 4 were proceeded ex parte  on 10.03.2017 and an ex parte  decree was \npassed on 11.05.2017.  Learned counsel has submitted that for t he \nperiod 04.11.2016 to 11.05.2017 the defendant did not make an y \neffort to join the proceedings even though they were earlier aware of \nthe next date of hearing.  However, the learned Trial Court talking \ninto account the facts and circumstances of the case took a view ex \nparte  decree was set aside subject to the cost of Rs.1,000/- each upon  \nthe respondents.   \n9. The Order 9 Rule 13 CPC provides a remedy for the defendant to \napply to set aside the ex-parte decree which was passed due to the \nnon-appearance of the defendant in the civil suit.  \n10. In the present case, it is not the case of the parties that the s ummons \nwere not served upon the respondents. The summons were duly \nserved upon the respondents and they have also appeared, thereafter \nthey stopped appearing before learned Trial Court.  The learned T rial \nCourt was the best judge to ascertain the reasons for their no n-\nappearance.  The parties were not appearing before the learned Trial \ncourt and a view was taken that they might have stopped appear ing \nbeing an illiterate person.  The satisfaction of the court is para mount.  \nIt is also a settled proposition that the procedure is the ha ndmaid of \njustice.  The earnest endeavor of the courts are to adjudicate the \nmatter finally. Even the ex parte  decrees in some cases may not be \nexecuted  particularly in the present case wherein it has been alleged \nthat the respondents have illegally grabbed some land behind  the \nschool and they have stopped / blocked the emergency gate of the  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003757\n \nC.R.P. 3/2018  Page 4 of 4 school.  I consider that it would be in the overall interest of th e parties \nthat the matter is finally adjudicated after hearing both the parties. \n11.   In the revisional jurisdiction this court cannot set as ide a view only \nbecause a particular view has been taken by the Trial Court.  The Trial \nCourt in his wisdom has taken a view and has set aside ex parte  order. \nIt is not the case where either the jurisdiction has been mis used or the \njurisdiction has been exercised which was not vested in th e Trial \nCourt.   \n12.  I do not see any illegality or perversity in the order of the learn ed \nTrial Court. \n13.

The appellant has preferred the present appeal under Section 3 0 of the \nEmployee s’ Compensation Act, 1923 (hereinafter, referred to as the ‘Act’ ), \nassailing the order dated 16.04.2018 passed by the learned Com missioner, \nEmployee s’ Compensation in Case No.CEC-D/NE/18/2017/1125-1127, \nwhereby death compensation was awarded to respondent Nos.1  and 2/claimants \nand the appellant directed to deposit Rs.8,90,840/- alongwit h interest @ 12% \np.a. with effect from 19.07.2017 till realization. \n2. Brief facts, as emerge from the records, are that respondent Nos.1 an d 2 \nhad filed a petition under Section 22 of the Act, claiming co mpensation on \naccount of death of their son/ Nitish Gautam . As per the averments, Nitish \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:04.11.2022\n14:26:19\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/004653  \n \nFAO 4/2019          Page 2 of 6 \n Gautam , aged 20 years, was employed as a driver with respondent No.3 on th e \nlatter’s c ar bearing No. DL 7CM 0135  and was drawing wages @ Rs.12,000/- \nper month . The car was insured with the appellant. On 19.07.2013, while Nitish \nGautam  was driving the car in discharge of his duty at about 2:1 5 P.M., it went \nout of control near Sector-7, GT Road, Haryana  and collided with an Innova Car \ncoming from the opposite side. The body of Nitish Gautam  was recovered by \npolice officials and his postmortem was conducted at Governmen t Hospital, \nSonipat, Haryana. On account of fatal injuries received by the dece ased in the \naccident, an FIR bearing No.207/2013 was registered under Sections \n279/337/304A IPC at P.S. Murthal, Sonipat, Haryana.  \n3. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the claim ants failed to \nestablish employer-employee relationship between the deceased/ Nitish Gautam  \nand respondent No.3/employer in the proceedings before the learned  \nCommissioner. In this regard, he submitted that respondent No.3  is in fact real \nuncle of the deceased and could not have been his employer. In  support of his \nsubmission, learned counsel referred to the pleadings made before the MACT in \ncases filed separately on behalf of the present claimants as wel l as one Srishti \nRustagi , who was statedly a co-passenger of the deceased on the date o f the \naccident. To support his case, reliance was also placed by learne d counsel on a \ndecision of the Karnataka High Court in Divisional Manager, Unite d India \nInsurance Company Ltd., Davanagere v. Gujjamma and others reported as 2004 \nSCC OnLine Kar 30.   \n4. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 refuted \nthe submissions made on behalf of the appellant by contendin g that the \nemployer-employee relationship between deceased and respondent No.3 w as \nduly proved in the proceedings before the learned Commissioner. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:04.11.2022\n14:26:19\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/004653  \n \nFAO 4/2019          Page 3 of 6 \n 5. I have heard learned counsels for the parties as well as perused  the entire \nmaterial placed on record.  \n6. At the outset, it is pertinent to observe that in terms  of Section 30 of the \nAct, a challenge to the order of a Commissioner can be made only on a \nsubstantial question of law. In this regard, the Supreme Court in  North East \nKarnataka Road Transport Corporation v. Sujatha reported as (2019) 11 SCC \n514 has held the scope of an appeal under Section 30 of the Act to b e limited to \nsubstantial questions of law, and that findings of facts pro ved either way are not \nto be likely interfered with. Relevant excerpt from the decisio n is reproduced \nhereunder:- \n“9. At the outset, we may take note of the fact, being a settled  \nprinciple, that the question as to whether the employee met w ith an \naccident, whether the accident occurred during the course of \nemployment, whether it arose out of an employment, how and  in \nwhat manner the accident occurred, who was negligent in ca using \nthe accident, whether there existed any relationship of emplo yee \nand employer, what was the age and monthly salary of the \nemployee, how many are the dependents of the deceased employee,  \nthe extent of disability caused to the employee due to inju ries \nsuffered in an accident, whether there was any insurance co verage \nobtained by the employer to cover the incident etc. are some of the \nmaterial issues which arise for the just decision of th e \nCommissioner in a claim petition when an employee suffers a ny \nbodily injury or dies during the course of his employme nt and \nhe/his LRs sue(s) his employer to claim compensation under  the \nAct.  \n \n10. The aforementioned questions are essentially the questio ns \nof fact and therefore, they are required to be proved with the aid of \nevidence.  Once they are proved either way, the findings recor ded \nthereon are regarded as the findings of fact. \n \n11. The appeal provided under Section 30 of the Act to the Hi gh \nCourt against the order of the Commissioner lies only aga inst the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:04.11.2022\n14:26:19\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/004653  \n \nFAO 4/2019          Page 4 of 6 \n specific orders set out in clauses (a) to (e) of Section 30 of the Act \nwith a further rider contained in the first proviso t o the section that \nthe appeal must involve substantial questions of law.  \n \n12. In other words, the appeal provided under Section 30 of th e \nAct to the High Court against the order of the Commissi oner is not \nlike a regular first appeal akin to Section 96 of the Co de of Civil \nProcedure, 1908 which can be heard both on facts and law.  Th e \nappellate jurisdiction of the High Court to decide the ap peal is \nconfined only to examine the substantial questions of la w arising in \nthe case.”   \n \n7. Recently, the same view has been voiced again by the Supreme Cou rt in \nShahajahan and another v. Shriram General Ins. Co. Ltd. and another reported as \n2022 ACJ 203.  \n \n8. The only challenge made in the present appeal is to the emp loyer-\nemployee relationship between the deceased and respondent No.3,  for which \nlearned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the pleadings in MACT case by \nco-passenger/ Srishti Rustagi, wherein it was stated that none of the passengers \nin the car was employed on the day of the accident . \n9. On this aspect, it is noted that before the Commissioner, the cl aimants had \ncategorically averred that the deceased was employed with responden t No.3, \nwho was also admittedly his uncle. Respondent No.3 (Respon dent No.1 before \nthe learned Commissioner) supported the case of the claimants an d his \naverments were summarized in the impugned order as follows:- \n“Respondent No.1 admitted that deceased Nitish Gautam was \nemployed by him as driver and he was paid salary Rs. 12,000 /- \np.m. Plus Rs. 100/- as diet money. Respondent No. 1 stated t hat \ndeceased Nitish Gautam was employed as driver by him on hi s \nvehicle number DL-7-CM-0135 and the said vehicle was insure d \nwith respondent No. 2 i.e. ICICI Lombard General Insurance \nCompany Ltd., vide Certificate cum Policy No. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:04.11.2022\n14:26:19\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/004653  \n \nFAO 4/2019          Page 5 of 6 \n 3001/62159525/02/000 valid from 21 November 2012 to 20  \nNovember 2013 and the said insurance company is liable to pay the \ncompensation.”  \n \n10. It is not disputed by the appellant that the car in wh ich the deceased was \ntravelling on the date of the accident was insured with it. It is also not disputed \nthat the insurance policy in question was valid and subsistin g on the said date. \n11. Though reliance is sought to be placed by the appellant  on the statement \nof co-passenger/ Srishti Rustagi , as well as written statement of respondent No.3 \nfiled before the MACT, this Court is of the opinion that t he same are of no avail \nto the appellant in view of the specific averments made in the clai m proceedings \nbefore the learned Commissioner by the claimants as well as admi ssion by \nrespondent No.3 in his written statement, to the effect that at the t ime of the \naccident, the deceased was employed with respondent No.3. It is w orthwhile to \nnote that co-passenger/ Srishti Rustagi was admittedly not examined in the \nproceedings before the learned Commissioner. \nIn this view of the matter, reliance sought to be placed by t he appellant on \nthe decision in Gujjamma (Supra) is misplaced. The contention tha t the \nemployer-employee relationship between the deceased and responde nt No.3 is \nnot established as respondent No.3 is an uncle of the decease d, is specious and \nbeing meritless is rejected.        \n12. The appellant having failed to make out any case for interfe rence, the \nimpugned order is upheld and the present appeal is dismiss ed alongwith the \npending application. Let the compensation amount deposited  by the appellant \nwith the learned Commissioner, alongwith any interest accrued thereup on, be \nreleased to the claimants forthwith. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:04.11.2022\n14:26:19\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/004653  \n \nFAO 4/2019          Page 6 of 6 \n 13.

Petitioner \nThrough: Mr. Pallav Saxena, Mr. Syed Arsalan, \nMr. Prateek Khaitan, Mr. Chatanya \nSharma, Mr. Shitij Chakravarty and \nMr. Sikander Hyatt Khan, Advocates. \nversus  \n \n AVTAR KRISHAN BHAT    .....

This hearing has been done through video conferencing.  \n2. The present revision petition challenges the impugned order dated 9th \nAugust 2018 in CS No. 142/2018  titled Avtar Krishan Bhat v. The Jammu & \nKashmir Bank ltd.  passed by the ld. ADJ-02 (North-West) Rohini Courts, Delhi \n(here inafter “Trial Court”). Vide the said order, the application moved by the \nPetitioner/Defendant (hereinafter “Defendant Bank”)  under Order VII Rule 11 \nCPC has been dismissed by the Trial Court. Thereafter, the suit has proceeded, \nissues have been framed in the matter and the Trial Court has proceeded with the \nrecording of evidence.  \n3.  The background of the case is that the Respondent/Plaintiff- Mr. Avtar \nKrishan Bhat (hereinafter “Plaintiff”)  was employed as a Probationary Officer \nwith the Defendant Bank in the year 1989 and he was thereafter, promoted from \ntime to time. Finally, he was posted as Branch Manager in Ghaziabad branch in \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 2 of 11 \n June 2013. It is the case of the Plaintiff that he was fulfilling his duties honestly \nand diligently. However, vide the suspension order bearing no. CHQ/DD/2014-\n224 dated 17th November 2014 the Plaintiff was placed under suspension. Later, \nhe was terminated vide termination letter dated 12th February 2015. According to \nthe Defendant Bank, the termination was issued on the basis of Rule 262 of the \nJammu and Kashmir Bank Limited Officers Service Rules, 2000 (hereinafter \n“Rules”) . \n4.  The case of the Plaintiff is that he had worked with dilige nce and \nhonesty for a period of 26 years with the Defendant Bank.  H e has given \nvarious reasons to argue that the termination done by the Defendant  Bank \nwas mala fide . As per the plaint, the Plaintiff claims that even if the \ntermination was under Rule 262 of the Rules, he was entitled to g et \nretirement benefits on the basis of service rendered by him. The Plai ntiff is \nstated to have made repeated representations to the Defendant Bank to \nreview the termination order which did not bear any fruit.  Acco rdingly, he \nfiled the present suit seeking declaration and various other monetary re liefs. \n5.  The stand taken by the Defendant Bank before the Trial Court w as \nthat the suit itself was not maintainable.  According to the Defendant Bank, \nthe Plaintiff’s suit was nothing but enforcement of contract o f personal \nservice, which was not specifically enforceable in view of sec tion 14(1)(b) \nand 41 of the Specific Relief Act,1963 (hereinafter “SRA”) .  The Defendant \nBank, accordingly, filed an application under Order VII R ule 11 CPC before the \nTrial Court seeking rejection of the plaint.   Vide a short order, the Trial Court \ndismissed the said application in the following terms-  \n“Application filed on behalf of the defendant u/o 7 \nRule 11 CPC stating therein that the suit is not \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 3 of 11 \n maintainable because it is related to the contract \nof personal services. \n  The application is flimsy. The suit would have \nbeen barred had it been for the enforcement of the \ncontract of service contract but the suit is on the \ncontrary based upon the breach of the service \ncontract. The plaintiff is seeking that his \ntermination was illegal and hence he is seeking \nrecovery of salary and other service benefits. The \napplication is without force and I am dismissing \nthe same without seeking its reply. ” \n \n6.  Mr. Saxena, ld. Counsel appearing for the Defendant Bank, submits \nthat the suit is for enforcement of a contract of service. The Plain tiff was \nguilty of discounting more than 200 fake and fictitious Letter s of Credit \n(LCs) leading to loss of more than Rs.32 crores to the Defendant Ban k.  \nAccordingly, the Bank had to take extreme steps of terminating him from \nservice.  He submits that in terms of the judgment of the Sup reme Court in \nJitendra Nath Biswas   v.   Empire of India and Ceylon Tea Co. and O rs., \n1989 3 SCC 582 , the only remedy for the Plaintiff can be a suit for damages \nand he cannot file a suit for specific performance of contract. He sub mits \nthat accordingly, the manner in which the present suit has been  structured \nwould show that the Plaintiff is seeking back wages, pension a nd other \nmonetary benefits including promotion, as though he had con tinued in \nservice. Thus, the plaint, as structured, would not be maintain able in his \nsubmission.  \n7.  On the other hand, Mr. Anil Kumar Chandel, ld. Counsel appearin g \nfor the Plaintiff, submits that the present suit is not one fo r specific \nperformance of contract of service.  The prayers would make it clear that it \nis primarily for seeking declaration and damages.  The manner in which the \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 4 of 11 \n prayer is worded is merely to show the quantification of damages  and \nnothing more.  He relies upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court in \nIntertek India v. Priyanka Mohan, [C.R.P. 215/2019, decided on 2 7th \nSeptember, 2019] .  He submits that the termination by the Defendant Bank \nwas itself mala fide , inasmuch as per Rule 262 of the Rules, the employee is \nentitled to retirement benefits, which has also been denied to the Plai ntiff.   \n8.  This Court has heard the counsels for the parties and perused the \nrecord. The first and the foremost issue on which there is n o dispute is that \nthe Plaintiff was working in a managerial capacity.  Thus, th e Plaintiff \ncannot invoke the provisions of the Industrial Disputes A ct, 1947 \n(hereinafter “ID Act”) .  It is in this backdrop that the maintainability of the \nsuit would have to be considered.  The pleadings in the plaint are as un der: \n“11. That the malafide of the action of the \nDefendant is evident from the fact that even as per \nthe aforesaid Rule 262, the Plaintiff is entitled to \nthe retirement benefits alongwith pension, as he \nhas already completed more than 20 years in \nservice, however, the Defendant has not even \ngranted any pension to the Plaintiff till date.  The \nPlaintiff has not accepted his termination and till \ndate has not encashed the Demand Draft/Pay \norder sent along with the letter of termination.  \nXxx \n13.    That the termination of the Plaintiff is highly \nstigmatic, which has not only deprived the \nPlaintiff from his service benefits, but has also \ndeprived him to seek any employment somewhere \nelse and as is continuously been affecting the life \nand liberties of the Plaintiff and his family.  \n14.     That since the Defendant has illegally \nterminated the services of the Plaintiff, \ntherefore, the Defendant is liable to pay damages \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 5 of 11 \n to the Plaintiff.   The Plaintiff is entitled to the \nmonetary benefits in terms of the back wages, will \nall the applicable increments.  Further the \nPlaintiff is also entitled to pension, as per rules, \nafter the age of superannuation.  The Plaintiff is \nentitled to the following amount, till date.   \n     \nS.NO. Particulars Amount (in Rs.) \n1 Unpaid Salary, \nfrom December, \n2014 till date Rs.95609  X 38 \nMonths          = \nRs.36,33,142/- \n2 Grade Revision of \n15%, done in Dec., \n2014, made \napplicable \nretrospectively from \nSeptember, 2012 Rs.14341  X  65 \nmonths         = \nRs.9,32,165/- \nGRAND TOTAL Rs.45,65,307/-. \n \n15.   That the Plaintiff is also entitled to the future \nsalary, till the age of superannuation/retirement, \nalongwith the pension, from such date, which he \nwould have otherwise received, had his services \nnot been illegally terminated, alongwith the other \nservice benefits, which are not in his knowledge \nor which would be notified by the Defendant in \nfuture.  It is submitted that since the termination \nof the Plaintiff is stigmatic, therefore, the Plaintiff \nis not been able to earn the aforesaid amount, \nanywhere else, despite best of his efforts.  Besides \nthe aforementioned the Plaintiff is also entitled to \ncompensation for the mental agony and \nharassment undergone, due to the illegal actions \nof the Defendant. ” \n \n 9.  The reliefs sought in the plaint are as under: \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 6 of 11 \n “a) Pass a decree of declaration, thereby \ndeclaring the Service Rule 262 of the Officers \nService Manual, 2000 to be null and void and \naccordingly, the termination of the Plaintiff to be \nalso null and void; \nPass a decree of declaration, thereby declaring \nthe letter of termination, dated 12.02.2015 of the \nDefendant, to be null and void and consequent \ntermination of the employment/services of the \nPlaintiff to be null and void; \nb)  Pass a money decree, for an amount of \nRs.52,66,788/- (Rupees Fifty Two Lakhs Sixty Six \nThousand Seven Hundred & Eighty Eight only, in \nfavour of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant; \nc)  Pass a money decree, for the pendent lite and \nfuture damages/salary, @ the rate of \nRs.1,09,950/- (Rupees One Lakh Nine Thousand \nNine Hundred & Fifty only) per month, alongwith \nthe applicable increments and other benefits, \nwhich would become applicable, from time to \ntime, till the date of his superannuation, as per \nrules, in favour of the Plaintiff and against the \nDefendant; \nd)  Pass a decree for pendente lite and future \ninterest @ 12% per annum, on the amount \npayable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, from the \ndate of the amount becoming due till its actual \npayment, in favour of the Plaintiff and against the \nDefendant; \ne)  Pass a decree of mandatory injunction, \nthereby directing the Defendant to grant the \npension benefits of the Plaintiff, from the date of \nhis superannuation i.e., 60 years, or any other \nappropriate date, which this Hon’ble Court deems \notherwise fit and proper; ” \n \n10.  A perusal of the above extracts of the plaint would sh ow that \nprimarily there is a challenge to Rule 262 of the Rules and declarat ion is \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 7 of 11 \n sought to the effect that the termination is illegal. The dictu m of Jitendra \nNath Biswas (supra)  is not applicable in the present case as it was held by \nthe Supreme Court in the facts of that case that the jurisdicti on of the civil \ncourt was excluded because the ID Act was applicable and thus, an  effective \nremedy was available to the workman under the ID Act. The relevant \nobservation of the Supreme Court are as under- \n“Xxx    Xxx     Xxx \nIt is therefore clear that this Act i.e. Industrial Disput es \nAct not only confers the right on a worker for \nreinstatement and back wages if the order of \ntermination or dismissal is not in accordance with the \nStanding Orders but also provides a detailed procedure \nand machinery for getting this relief. Under these \ncircumstances therefore there is an apparent implied \nexclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court. In \nDhulabhai's case a five-Judges Bench of this Court \nconsidered the language of Section 9 and the scope \nthereof in respect of exclusion of jurisdiction and it wa s \nobserved: \nWhere there is no express exclusion the \nexamination of the remedies and the \nscheme of the particular Act to find out the \nintendment becomes necessary and the \nresult of the inquiry may be decisive. In the \nlatter case, it is necessary to see if the \nstatute creates a special right or a liability \nand provides for the determination of the \nright or liability and further lays down that \nall questions about the said right and \nliability shall be determined by the \ntribunals so constituted, and whether \nremedies normally associated with actions \nin civil courts are prescribed by the said \nstatute or not. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 8 of 11 \n It is therefore clear that the scheme of the Industrial \nDisputes Act clearly excludes the jurisdiction of the \ncivil court by implication in respect of remedies which  \nare available under this Act and for which a complete \nprocedure and machinery has been provided in this \nAct.” \n \n11.  In the opinion of this Court, the Plaintiff cannot be sta ted to be having \nan alternative remedy in the present case to challenge the termin ation in \nview of the non-applicability of the provisions of the ID  Act. Thus, a civil \nsuit challenging the termination would be maintainable in these facts. \n12.  Insofar as the monetary reliefs are concerned, a perusal of the \nparagraph 14 of the plaint would show that the Plaintiff cl aims that the \nDefendant is liable to pay damages, however, it thereafter goes ahead to \nclaim monetary benefits in terms of back wages, grade pay revisi on, and \nretirement benefits. The question as to whether this would cons titute \ndamages or would be in the form of back wages and other service be nefits, \nwould be an issue that the Trial Court would have to adjudic ate, if the \ndeclaratory relief sought by the Plaintiff is granted.  At this stage, the case of  \nthe Plaintiff that it is the computation of damages and the cas e of the \nDefendant that it is a case for back wages, cannot be rejected si mply on the \nground that the plaint is not maintainable in an applicat ion under Order VII \nRule 11 CPC. As per paragraph 14 of the plaint the Plaintiff claims that the \nDefendant is liable to pay the damages to the Plaintiff.  The claim of back \nwages obviously, as is granted under the ID Act, cannot be sought  or granted \nin a civil suit. The only relief that the Plaintiff can seek is for declaration and \ndamages.  If the Trial Court is of the opinion that the relief so ught could be \nconsidered as damages, only then the Trial Court can consider the s ame. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000593\n \nC.R.P. 1/2019 Page 9 of 11 \n This would also be permissible for consideration only if t he Plaintiff \nsucceeds in the relief of declaration which is sought for by him.                   \n13.  Insofar the pensionary benefits are concerned, the Trial Cour t would \nhave to adjudicate the question as to whether under the Rule 262  of the \nRules, even in case of termination in these facts, the Plaintiff woul d be \nentitled to retiral benefits including pension ",

The said notice required the petitione r‟s authorized representative to \nmake an appearance on the date stipulated i.e., 20.11.2018. \n2. Besides this, the petitioner has also sought a direction fo r a refund of \nRs.2 crores which was made over as a pre-deposit for the purposes of having  \nits objection heard by the Special Commissioner-I, Department o f Trade and \nTaxes, GNCTD.  \n2.1.  In addition, thereto, mandamus  is also sought for grant of interest on \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 2 of 13  \n the delayed release of above-mentioned pre-deposit i.e., Rs.2 crores.  \n3. We may indicate at the very outset that insofar as prayer clauses  (b) \nand (c) of the writ petition are concerned, they concededly stand sat isfied \nduring the pendency of the proceedings. Rs. 2 crores was refunded  to the \npetitioner, pursuant to the order dated 08.01.2020 passed by this Co urt.  \n3.1. We are informed that the said sum was refunded to the petiti oner, \nalong with interest. \n4. It is important to note that the impugned notice dated 1 5.11.2018 \nseeks to revise the order dated 22.03.2017 passed by the Speci al \nCommissioner – II i.e., the Objection Hearing Authority [hereafter referred \nto as “OHA”] and the consequent order dated 26.02.2018 passed by the \nAssessing Officer [hereafter referred to as “AO”] .  \n5. The respondent seeks to revise the aforementioned orders passe d by \nthe OHA and the assessment order, by taking recourse to the power s \nconferred on the said authority under 74A of the Act.  \n6. Before we proceed further, it is relevant to have a brief overview o f \nthe facts obtaining in the instant case, which have led to the institution of the \npresent petition. \n6.1. The petitioner, which is in the business of importing and  trading \nlaptops, mobile phones and streaming devices, while paying tax , had \nclassified one of the devices, which is known as „Apple Watc h‟, under the \nresidual  entry.  \n6.2. Consequently, the tax, which was offered by the petitioner, with \nrespect to the abovementioned device, was calculated at rate of 12.5%.  \n7.       Insofar as the A.O. was concerned, he was of view that the said \nproduct i.e., Apple Watch, ought to have been classified as „Watch‟ under \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 3 of 13  \n Entry No. 12 of the Fourth Schedule of the Act,  and therefore, the petitioner \nought to have paid tax at the rate of 20%. \n7.1.  The A.O., thus, repelled the contention of the petitioner t hat Apple \nWatch could be classified under the residuary entry. Accordingly, by  an \norder dated 17.02.2016, the assessment order was framed under Section 3 2 \nof the Act and a demand amounting to Rs.7,32,83,675/- was ra ised qua the \npetitioner.  \n7.2.   The demand included tax amounting to Rs.7,25,08,922/- an d interest \npegged at Rs.7,74,753/-. \n7.3. It is this assessment, which led to the petitioner filin g its objection \nwith the OHA under Section 74 of the Act. As indicated above, th e \npetitioner made a pre-deposit of Rs.2 crores, to have its objections heard.  \n7.4. The OHA, after hearing the authorized representative of the petit ioner \nas well as the respondent, via order dated 22.03.2017, reversed the view \ntaken by the A.O.  \n7.5.   In brief, the OHA concluded that Apple Watches were not just watc hes \nbut transmission devices and, therefore, had to be assessed u nder the \nresiduary entry. In effect, the stand taken by the petitioner that the tax qua \nthe said devices would get attracted at the rate of 12.5%, was accepted by \nthe OHA.  \n7.6. Consequentially, a fresh assessment order was passed on 26 .02.2018. \nThis resulted in the tax demand being reduced to nil. \n7.7.  Enthused by this, the petitioner filed an application fo r refund of Rs.2 \ncrores made over as a pre-deposit. As noticed above, after some back a nd \nforth, in this Court, the said amount was refunded to the pe titioner, with \ninterest.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 4 of 13  \n 8. Therefore, the only aspect that needs to be adjudicated is: whether the \nrespondent has correctly invoked the provisions of Section 74A o f the Act \nby issuing the impugned show-cause notice dated 15.11.20 18, qua the order \ndated 22.03.2017 passed by the OHA and the consequent asses sment order \ndated 26.02.2018 passed by the AO.  \n9. We may also note that this Court, via the very same order whereby it \nhad directed the refund of the amount made over by the petitio ner as pre-\ndeposit, had also directed the respondent to furnish reasons for issuing the \nimpugned show-cause notice dated 15.11.2018, to the petitioner. As  \nadverted to hereinabove, this order is dated 08.01.2020.  \n9.1. There is no dispute that the reasons which were available in the \nrespondent‟s record, have been furnished to the petitioner‟s counsel.  \nSubmissions of Counsel:  \n10. Mr Rohan Shah, who appears on behalf of the petitioner, has, broa dly, \nmade the following submissions:   \n10.1.  A perusal of the reasons furnished by the respondent wo uld show that \nthey do not satisfy the twin test prescribed under Section 74A  for triggering \nthe revisionary jurisdiction. According to Mr Shah, the authorit y exercising \nrevisionary jurisdiction would have to demonstrate that the orders passed by \nthe OHA and the AO i.e., orders dated 22.03.2017 and 26.02.2018 \nrespectively were both erroneous and prejudicial to the interests o f the \nrevenue. \n10.2.  It was further contended by Mr Shah that a close examinatio n of the \nreasons would show that no such error has been flagged in th e reasons \nfurnished by the respondent. \n10.3.  In support of his submissions, Mr Shah has relied u pon the following \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 5 of 13  \n judgements: \n(a) Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi III v. Carrier Aircon Ltd ., \n2005 (184) ELT 113 (SC). \n(b) Malabar Industrial Company Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, \nKerala State  (2000) 2 SCC 718. \n(c) Garg Roadlines v. Commissioner of Trade and Taxes  2017 (4) 100 \nVST 275. \n11. On the other hand, Mr Satyakam, who appears on behalf of the \nrespondent, in defence of the impugned action taken by the respon dent in \nissuing the show-cause notice dated 15.11.2018, has relied upo n both the \ncontents of the said notice, as well as the reasons furnished therein.  \n11.1. It is Mr Satyakam‟s contention that there is an error concerning \nclassification which has cropped up in the orders that are s ought to be \nrevised; because of which the rate at which tax was paid was s ubstantially \nlower than that which ought to have been charged in the instant case. Thus, \naccording to Mr Satyakam, the twin test, as stipulated in Section  74A of the \nAct, stood satisfied. \n11.2. It was also brought to our notice by Mr Satyakam that up on Special \nLeave Petition (SLP) being preferred in the Garg Roadlines  case, leave has \nbeen granted.  \n11.3. On being queried, Mr Satyakam has fairly conceded that there i s no \nstay on the operation of the judgment in the Garg Roadlines case.  \n11.4.  Mr Satyakam has informed us that in another matter concerning th e \nGarg Roadlines , which pertained to refund, also travelled to the Supreme \nCourt and like in the other matter, the SLP has been converted t o an appeal. \nHowever, in this matter we are told the operation of the judgment o f this \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 6 of 13  \n Court dated 22.03.2017 has been stayed. \nAnalysis and Reasons:  \n12. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. \nAccording to us, insofar as the dispute with regard to class ification is \nconcerned, it was clearly, in this case, a mixed question of fact and l aw. \n13. The OHA, via its order dated 22.03.2017, considered the contentions \nadvanced by the petitioner as well as the respondent. It is ther eafter that the \nOHA concluded that Apple Watches were essentially transmissi on devices. \nThe relevant portion of the order is extracted hereafter:  \n“ xxx     xxx     xxx  \n \nI have heard both the parties and I am of the view that if  Apple Watch \nis fully synced with the main device only then it would s how correct \ntime and it would not work if it is not paired and synced wit h the main \ndevice like an Iphone 5S or above category and the correctness of  \ntime cannot be ensured if the main device is taken away beyon d the \nspecified range. Moreover, except time various other features ar e \navailable for the use of patrons like receipt of message, em ail, display \nof incoming calls, taking up of calls, making outgoing calls and other \napplication based features like health, fitness, music, cam era, \nnavigation etc. therefore restricting classification simpl y to be a \nwatch does seem prudent moreover it should be classified a s a \ntransmission device which works only with the mother device wh en \npaired and connected. \n \nThe contention of the objector that the device Apple watch q ualifies to \nbe a transmission device is well substantiated by the Mini stry of \nFinance notification No. 12/2016 – Central Excise (N.T) dated \n01.03.2016. Also the Advance Ruling Authority for Central Excise, \nCustoms and Service Tax also held that Apple Watch is a \ntransmission device under Chapter 85. The principal funct ion of any \nproduct is the determining factor for classification o f any product \nunder any category, as the main function of Apple Watch is related to \nthe Mother device Apple I Phone 5S and above without which th e \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 7 of 13  \n Apple watch will not work as such Apple Watch should be ter med as \nan accessory and classifiable under Entry 41A of the Sche dule III of \nthe DVAT Act. With the above observation, I am of the view  that the \nimpugned order needs to be revisited by AA and the same i s set aside. \nThe case is remanded back AA for reframing the assessment order \nafter duly considering the classification under Central  Excise and \nCustoms Classification and Higher Court Rulings. ‖ \n \n14. Therefore, the contention that is now sought to be advance d on behalf \nof the revenue by Mr Satyakam, that there was error of law in classifying the \ndevices in issue i.e., Apple Watches, as transmission devices , needed to be \nconsidered by the revisionary authority, does not impress us.  \n14.1.    The approach to be adopted in these matters, as correctly  pointed out \nby Mr Shah, is that an error has to be found in the underlying  order which is \nsought to be revised.  \n14.2.   As noted above, the error concerning classification canno t be \nseparated from the facts obtaining in the case.  \n15. We may, at this juncture, also note that Mr Satyakam has c ontended \nthat the recourse to revisionary power was taken, as no appeal was  available \nagainst the order passed by the OHA i.e., order dated 22.03.2017. \n15.1. Mr Shah, in his submissions, has refuted this content ion and in this \nbehalf, has drawn our attention to Section 76 of the Act. Section  76 of the \nAct reads as follows: \n―76: Appeals to Appellate Tribunal (Rules 57A to 57C) \n \n(1) Any person aggrieved by a decision made by the Commissioner  \nunder sections 74, 84 and 85 of this Act may appeal to  the \nAppellate Tribunal against such decision: \n \nPROVIDED that no appeal may be made against a non-appea lable \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 8 of 13  \n order under section 79 of this Act \n \nExplanation. The Commissioner does not appeal to the Appe llate \nTribunal but may make a re-assessment of tax where he is of t he \nopinion that further tax is owed. \n \nxxx     xxx     xxx ‖ \n \n16. We are of the view that Mr Shah is right,  an appeal would lie from the \norder passed by the OHA, which is an order passed under Section 7 4, and \nwhich is one of the sections referred to in Section 76(1). This p rovision \nenables an appeal to be preferred with the Appellate Tribunal.  \n16.1.   The explanation to Section 76 of the Act (extracted above), on which \nreliance is placed by Mr Satyakam, to contend that no appeal would l ie \nagainst the order of the OHA, seems to be confined to those cases where the \nCommissioner chooses not to appeal to the Appellate Tribunal , but instead, \nopts to make a reassessment of tax where he is of the opinion that further ta x \nis owed.  \n16.2.    If Mr Satyakam‟s submission is accepted that an error concerning \nclassification had crept in, then, in our view, an appeal cou ld have been \ninstituted with the Appellate Tribunal, which then would h ave examined the \nissue, both on facts as well as the law.  \n16.3. However, that opportunity seems to have been lost by t he \nrespondent/revenue, by not triggering the appeal process under Section 76 of  \nthe Act. \n17. Be that as it may, this aspect need not detain us, for the reason that the \nreasons placed before us, which, as indicated above, are embedded in the \nrespondent‟s record, do not even remotely suggest as to how  the \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/002801\nW.P.(C) 120/2019     Page 9 of 13  \n OHA‟s/A.O.‟ s order is erroneous.  \n17.1.   For the sake of convenience, the reasons are extracted hereafter: \n \n―1) The issue at hand is  an interesting matter wherein VATO of W- \n208(KCS) raised a demand of approx. Rs.7.5 crore for Oct-Dec 2015 \nquarter vide its order dt 17/2/16 i.e. with in a month of  filing of return \nfor that quarter. It was subsequently objected by the asse ssee before \nOHA, who in turn remanded it back to ward VATO after sett ing aside \nthe previous demand of Rs. 7.5 cr. and by stating that A pple watches \nare transmission devices as a part of iphone and not i ndependent \nwatches, thus attracting VAT rate @ 12.5 % (as applicable f or \niphone) and not @ 20% (as applicable for watches of value > \nRs.5000). \n2) It is a continuous production/sale by the said company.

Brief facts necessary for deciding the present petition are set out \nhereinafter: \n3.1  The plaintiff and the defendant no. 1 got married on 24th March, 2002 \nbut soon thereafter, the petitioner left for Canada. Differences arose  between \nthem, which resulted in filing of police complaints by the d efendant no. 1 \nagainst the plaintiff. \n3.2  On 3rd March, 2004 a ‘Red Corner Notice’ (RCN) was issued against \nthe plaintiff, who, at that point of time was in Canada, in whic h it was \nincorrectly recorded that the maximum possible penalty for the of fences \nallegedly committed by the plaintiff was 10 years, whereas t he maximum \npunishment prescribed for the said offences under Sections 498A, 40 6 and \n34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1908 (IPC) was three years. \n3.3  The plaintiff filed a writ petition before this Court seeking quashi ng \nof the illegal RCN and the LOC issued against the plaintiff, bei ng W.P.Crl. \n1315/2008, and vide the order dated 11th August, 2010, this Court allowed \nthe petition and quashed the RCN. \n3.4  The suit from which the present petition arises, being CS 58517/16, \nwas filed on 10th August, 2011 seeking damages of Rs.50,00,000/- against, \ninter alia , the respondent no. 1, being defendant no. 7, and the respondent \nno. 2, being defendant no. 1, in the suit. \n3.5  The suit was premised on damage to the plaintiff’s career, rep utation \nand life caused by the misuse and abuse of the legal process i n getting a \n‘Look Out Circular’ (LOC) and RCN issued by the defendants ag ainst the \nplaintiff. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 3 of 10 \n 3.6  The case set up in the plaint was that the defendant no. 1, who was \nmarried to the plaintiff, used her brother, defendant no. 7, who was a s enior \nIPS officer, to have a false FIR lodged and illegal LOC and RCN i ssued \nagainst the plaintiff, which caused immense harm to his career and  \nreputation. \n3.7  The said suit was contested by the defendants by filing a writt en \nstatement. In the said suit, the defendants no. 5 and 6 filed two a pplications \nunder Order I Rule 10 of the CPC seeking deletion of their names from the  \narray of parties and the Single Judge, vide judgment dated 20th February, \n2015 dismissed the application filed by the defendant no. 5 but allow ed the \napplication filed by the defendant no. 6. However, vide judgment dated 1st \nFebruary, 2016, a Division Bench of this Court deleted defendants no. 5 a nd \n6 from the array of parties. The plaintiff filed a Special Leave P etition \nagainst the said judgment, which is pending before the Supreme Court. \n3.8  On 29th February, 2016, the suit was transferred to the District Court. \n3.9  Thereafter, the defendants no. 1 and 7 filed a joint application u nder \nOrder I Rule 10 and Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC seeking (i) the ir \ndeletion from the array of parties; and, (ii) rejection of the  plaint. The \nimpugned order dated 6th February, 2018 allowed the application partially \nby rejecting the plaint qua the defendant no. 7 and deleting the defendant no. \n7 from the array of parties. However, the plaint was not rejected  qua  the \ndefendant no. 1. The impugned order held that: \n(i) in the whole plaint, there are vague allegations of collusion \nagainst the defendant no. 7; \n(ii)  no particulars have been given by the plaintiff as to how the \ndefendant no. 7 was involved in issuing of LOC or RCN; \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 4 of 10 \n (iii)  the defendant no. 7 being the brother of the defendant no. 1 and \nan IPS officer cannot be a ground to implead him in the suit  on the \nbasis of vague allegations of collusion; \n(iv)  based on the aforesaid, it was held by the Trial Court that t here \nis no cause of action against the defendant no. 7 and hence, the pl aint \nqua him was rejected; \n(v)  the application under Order I Rule 10 of the CPC has been filed \non the same grounds as the application filed under Order VII Rule \n11(a) of the CPC and accordingly, the defendant no. 7 was deleted \nfrom the array of parties. \n3.10 The plaintiff preferred a review application against the afores aid \njudgment of the Trial Court, which was dismissed by the i mpugned order \ndated 12th July, 2018 by observing that the judgment dated 11th august, 2020 \npassed by this Court in W.P. Crl 1315/2008 does not help the case of  the \nplaintiff and there are no specific allegations against the de fendant no. 7 in \nthe plaint. \n4. The counsel for the petitioner contended that (i) averments hav e been \nmade against the defendant no. 7 with regard to his involvement and \ncollusion with the defendant no. 1 so as to initiate various unl awful \nproceedings against the plaintiff, resulting in issuance of the R CN and the \nLOC. In this regard, attention of the Court is drawn to paragraphs 5 , 6 (xiv), \n(xxii), (xxvi), (xxvii), (xxviii), (xxxii), (xxxiii) (xxxix) and 9 of the plaint ; \n(ii) a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the judgment dated 11th August, \n2010 in W.P.Crl. No.1315/2008 quashed the RCN issued against the \nplaintiff and observed in paragraph 10 of the said judgment that the LOC \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 5 of 10 \n against the plaintiff was issued in view of the fact that defend ant no. 7 was \nthe brother of defendant no. 1 and also an IPS officer; and, (iii) accordingly, \nkeeping in mind the principles to be applied while deciding an appli cation \nunder Order I Rule 10 of the CPC, defendant no. 7 is a necessary and pr oper \nparty to the suit and therefore, cannot be deleted from the array of parties. \n5. Defendant no.1 appeared in person on her own behalf as well as on \nbehalf of the defendant no. 7 as his Power of Attorney Holder.  S he submits \nthat (i) there is no infirmity in the impugned order as only vague averments \nhave been made in respect of the defendant no. 7; (ii) there is no finding  in \nthe judgment dated 11th August, 2010 against the defendant no. 7 and the \nobservations in paragraph 10 relied upon by the plaintiff are only al legations \nmade by the plaintiff and not findings of the Court.  Even otherwise, any  \nobservations made in the aforesaid judgment are not binding on the  \ndefendant no. 7 since the defendant no. 7 was not a party in aforesaid w rit \npetition; and, (iii) the defendant no.7 was not posted in Delhi at the relevant \npoint of time and therefore, could not have played any role in the issuanc e of \nRCN and LOC against the plaintiff.  \n6. I have perused the record and heard the counsels for the parties.   \n7. In order to decide the controversy at hand, it may be useful to ref er to \nthe principles to be applied while invoking principles of Order I Ru le 10 of \nthe CPC.  Order I Rule 10(2) of the CPC empowers the Court to delete or \nadd parties to the suit. In Vidur Impex and Traders Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. \nTosh Apartments Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. , (2012) 8 SCC 384, the Supreme Court \nhas succinctly laid down the principles to be followed while d eciding an \napplication filed under Order I Rule 10(2) of the CPC.  Paragraph 36 in thi s \nregard is set out below: \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 6 of 10 \n “36. Though there is apparent conflict in the observations mad e \nin some of the aforementioned judgments, the broad principles \nwhich should govern disposal of an application for impleadment \nare: \n \n1. The Court can, at any stage of the proceedings, either on an \napplication made by the parties or otherwise, direct impleadment \nof any person as party, who ought to have been joined as \nPlaintiff or Defendant or whose presence before the Court is \nnecessary for effective and complete adjudication of the issues \ninvolved in the suit. \n \n2. A necessary party is the person who ought to be joined a s \nparty to the suit and in whose absence an effective decree \ncannot be passed by the Court. \n \n3. A proper party is a person whose presence would enable the  \nCourt to completely, effectively and properly adjudicate upon \nall matters and issues, though he may not be a person in favour \nof or against whom a decree is to be made. \n \n4. If a person is not found to be a proper or necessary party, the \nCourt does not have the jurisdiction to order his impleadment \nagainst the wishes of the Plaintiff.” \n \n8. The Supreme Court in Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. Vs. \nRegency Convention Centre and Hotels Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. , (2010) 7 SCC \n417 has observed that the general rule in regard to impleadment of p arties is \nthat the plaintiff in a suit, being dominus litis , may choose the persons \nagainst whom he wishes to litigate and cannot be compelled to s ue a person \nagainst whom he does not seek any relief.   \n9. Applying the aforesaid principles to the present case, in my  view, a \nbare reading of the plaint discloses that the plaintiff has made a verments in \nthe plaint against the defendant no. 7, which are sufficient in nature for the \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 7 of 10 \n defendant no. 7 to be a necessary and a proper party for the adjudicat ion of \nthe suit.  Some of the averments made in the plaint with re gard to defendant \nno. 7 are set out below: \n “(xxii) The defendant No.1 using the contact network in the police \nand influence of her brother, Mr. Vikram Singh Mann, (who is a \nsenior IPS officer) managed to get an illegal Look-Out-Circ ular \n(LOC) issued against the plaintiff on the 27.05.2003 by an  who was \nnot even authorised to issue LOC. \n \nxxxx   xxxx   xxxx \n \n(xxvi) The defendant No.1 continued to harass the plaintiff and h is \nfamily in the garb of proceedings under Section 498-A/406/34 of IPC. \nThe defendant No.l with ulterior motives has spurned every effo rt by \nthe plaintiff/his family and their representatives to resolv e the matters \nin an amicable manner. Using her brother's, the defendant No.6, \ninfluence with the police, she managed to get an LOC issued against \nthe plaintiff on 30.05.2003. After lodging the F.I.R No.127 of 2003 \ndated 22.04.2003, a Red Corner Notice was also issued by 'lnte rpol \non 03.03.2004 and displayed on internet containing wrong and \nmisleading information about Nationality of plaintiff and alleged \ncrimes for which he was allegedly wanted, when the same was \nfactually incorrect. \n \nxxxx   xxxx   xxxx \n \n(xxxii) Since no response was received for a longtime, another notice \ndated 19.08.2008 was issued to defendant No.3 with a copy to the \nACP, Sub-Division, Narela. A letter dated 28.08.2008 was, thereafter, \nreceived from defendant No.2 according to which the Red Corne r \nNotice was issued at the behest of Delhi Police. The said not ice was \nthen amended but only the alleged offence of kidnapping had been \ndropped. The Interpol in their reply further stated that the 'Red \nCorner Notice' cannot be withdrawn unless Delhi Police asks  for the \nsame. Clearly such malicious acts were at the behest of defendant \nNo.6 & 1. It was not understood why the false criminal charge of \nCrimes against life and health was not removed from the 'Red C orner \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000117\n \nCM(M) 37/2019                           Page 8 of 10 \n Notice'. This ought to have been done with immediate effect.  \nMoreover, to the best of the knowledge of plaintiff there was no  arrest \nwarrant issued against him by any of the Hon'ble Courts in India.” \n10.  Not only the averments above, even in the prayer, damages have be en \njointly sought by the plaintiff against all the defendants including t he \ndefendant no. 7.   \n11.  The Trial Court has allowed the application under Order I Rule 10(2) \nof the CPC filed by the defendant no. 7 on the ground that only v ague \naverments have been made against the defendant no. 7 and no specific \nincidents showing the role of the defendant no.7 have been given.  \n12.  In my view, the averments made in the plaint, are sufficient for t he \nimpleadment of defendant no. 7 in the suit.  Whether or not th e said \naverments are true would be a matter of trial and the plaintiff  would have to \nprove the said averments in the trial.   But, at this stage , the plaintiff cannot \nbe denied an opportunity of proving the averments made by him aga inst the \ndefendant no. 7 in the suit. Counsel for the plaintiff has correctly pla ced \nreliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Syed Dastagir Vs. \nT.R.Gopalakrishnasetty , 1999 (6) SCC 337 to contend that the pleading has \nto be read as a whole to gather what has sought to be conveyed. \n13.  Even though while deciding an application under Order I Rule 10(2) \nof the CPC, reference has to be made to the averments made i n the plaint, \nthere is merit in the submission of the counsel for the plaintiff that in the \njudgment dated 11th August, 2010 there are observations made by this Court \nin respect of the role played by the defendant no. 7 in getting  the RCN/LOC \nissued against the plaintiff, which RCN was ultimately quashed b y this \nCourt vide the judgment dated 11th August, 2010.

This application seeks modification of the order dated \n23.05.2022, which, inter-alia,  recorded as under:  \n“4. The learned counsel for the appellant states that \nthe appellant would make an earnest endeavour to \nreconcile the matter and coordinate with the \nrespondents to facilitate resolution of the lis \nincluding sale of the property, preferably within a \nperiod of eight weeks.  \n5.

The applicant contends that the recording of his earnest \nendeavour to reconcile the matter and coordinate with the \nrespondents to facilitate resolution of the lis, including sale of the \nproperty within eight weeks, is erroneous. The said contentio n is \nincorrect as the order was passed on 23.05.2022 in open court i n the \npresence of counsel for the parties. \n3. Also, this application has been moved about eleven weeks \nthereafter. It is without merit and is dismissed.  \nEFA(OS) 1/2019 &CM APPL. 1191/2019 & CM APPL. \n21772/2019  \n \n4. The partition suit filed in the year 2007 apropos a residentia l \nproperty: B-8, Maharani Bagh, New Delhi was decreed. This decree \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:14.12.2022\n19:21:12Signature Not Verified\nNIC No.2022/DHC/005545 \nEFA(OS) 1/2019   Page 3 of 7 \n was impugned in FAO(OS) 701-702/2010. The said appeal resulte d \nin a consent decree passed by the Division Bench. It has attain ed \nfinality. In terms thereof the property was to be sold-off throug h a \nprivate sale. However, in the eventuality of the private sale n ot \nmaterialising then it was to be disposed-off through a buy er at the \nbest market rate. Neither of the aforesaid options fructified in  sale of \nthe property. Therefore, in the execution proceedings, it was directe d \nthat the property be sold-off through public auction, to which the \nappellant had no objection.  The order dated 12.11.2018 recor ds the \nconsent of the parties, which reads as under:- \n“1. The counsel for the decree holder states that he \nhas a buyer for the property no.B-8, Maharani Bagh, \nNew Delhi – 110 065 for a total value of Rs.45.5 \ncrores.   \n2. The counsel for the judgment debtor no.2 states \nthat the value of the property as per circle rates is \nover Rs.74 crores.  \n3. The counsel for the judgment debtor no.1 has \nnothing to say in this regard.  \n4.  Though I had in order dated 17th April, 2018 \nreferred to judgments holding that the court \nfees/stamp duty is not payable on a decree for \npartition by sale but since then, the Full Bench of this \nCourt in Indu Singh Vs. Prem Chaudhary  2018 SCC \nOnLine 8951 has held that court fees/stamp duty is \npayable on such a decree also. No court fee has been \npaid.  \n5. Though technically speaking there is no executable \ndecree till the said court fees is paid but the counsels \nfor all the parties state that they are not in a positio n \nto pay the court fee/stamp duty and all are agreeable \nthat the court fees/stamp duty be made first charge on \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:14.12.2022\n19:21:12Signature Not Verified\nNIC No.2022/DHC/005545 \nEFA(OS) 1/2019   Page 4 of 7 \n the sale proceeds.  \n6. Since the circle rate of the property is not disputed \nto be over Rs.74 crores and the buyer brought by the \ndecree holder is for Rs.45.5 crores only, there is no \noption but to put the property to be auctioned by the \nCourt Auctioneer. The parties have been cautioned of \nthe charges of the Court Auctioneer.  \n7. The Court Auctioneer is directed to put the \nproperty no.B-8, Maharani Bagh, New Delhi – \n110065 to auction in accordance with law. A copy of \nthis order be forwarded to the Court Auctioneer.  \n8. On enquiry, it is stated that all the three parties \nare in possession of the different parts of the property.  \n9. It is made clear that the sale of the property will \nbe with vacant possession of the property and if any of  \nthe parties at the appropriate stage fail to deliver \nvacant peaceful physical possession of the property, \nthey shall be liable to be evicted therefrom as if in \npursuance to a decree for possession.  \n10. The Court Auctioneer to also within one month of \ntoday submit the proposed sale proclamation along \nwith reserve price, for approval by the Court.”  \n \n5. The appellant now states that since the stamp duty on the  \namount as mentioned in para 2 of the impugned order has not been \npaid, the decree is not executable.  However, there is nothing in the  \nsaid order which can be read as an objection by the appellant apropos  \nsale through public auction.  All it records is that the parties are not in \na position to pay the court fee/stamp duty and further records that  all \nare agreeable that the court fee/stamp duty be made first charge on \nthe sale proceeds.  It further records that there is no optio n but to put \nthe property to be auctioned by the Court Auctioneer. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:14.12.2022\n19:21:12Signature Not Verified\nNIC No.2022/DHC/005545 \nEFA(OS) 1/2019   Page 5 of 7 \n 6. Mr Bindra, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant submits \nthat he had paid extra monies towards satisfying one part o f the \ndecree, in favour of Wadhwa’s , in execution petition Ex.P.61/2018, \ntherefore, the monies lying in the court would first need to  be \nadjusted/appropriated in favour of the appellant and the same m ay \nnot be used towards adjustment or payment of stamp duty.  Be that  as \nit may, the letter and spirit of the compromise decree is clear that the \nproperty shall be disposed-off at the best market price.  Private \nnegotiations have not resulted in the disposal of the property .  In the \norder dated 12.11.2018, it is recorded that the property shall  be \ndisposed-off by public auction.  The issue of stamp duty cann ot be a \nstumbling block because, on the sale proceeds, the first ch arge would \nbe towards payment of stamp duty.  The issue of adjustment and \napportionment of the monies lying in the Ex.P.61/2018 is  yet to be \ndetermined, apropos which the court would not say anything at  the \nmoment.   \n7. The effect of a decree without stamp duty would be that the \npurchaser would not be able to register the sale documents. Such  \ntransfer by a registered document would only be possible once the \nstamp duty is paid.  \n8. In Indu Singh Vs. Prem Chaudhary 2018 SCC OnLine 8951  \nreference was made to the decision of the dicta of the Supreme Court \nin Hindustan Steel Ltd. v. Dilip Construction Co., (1969) 1 SCC 597,  \nwhich reads, inter-alia , as under:  \n“…7. The Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to \nsecure revenue for the State on certain classes of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:14.12.2022\n19:21:12Signature Not Verified\nNIC No.2022/DHC/005545 \nEFA(OS) 1/2019   Page 6 of 7 \n instruments: It is not enacted to arm a litigant with a \nweapon of technicality to meet the case of his \nopponent. The stringent provisions of the Act are \nconceived in the interest of the revenue once that \nobject is secured according to law, the party staking \nhis claim on the instrument will not be defeated on \nthe ground of the initial defect in the instrument ….” \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \n9. In terms of the aforesaid orders, the property is to be sold-off \nby public auction and from the receipts the first charge would  be \ntowards payment of stamp duty. Therefore, the interests of the Stat e \nare secured and the apportionment of the proceeds between the \ndecree holders and the transfer of rights would be done thereafter. It \ncannot be the case of any consenting party that the compromise \ndecree be frustrated because the parties are unable to pay the court \nfee, especially when the suit property is said be of far more value \nthan the stamp-duty/ court fees. \n10.   The parties state that they do not have the financial \nwherewithal to pay the stamp duty, which is roughly Rs.26-27 lakhs . \nAccording to the learned counsel for the appellant, the pro perty is \notherwise stated to be over Rs.100 crores whereas the learned counsel \nfor the respondents states that the market value of the propert y is \naround Rs.60-65 crores.  The mutual consent of the parties as \nrecorded in the compromise decree is not an issue.  The parties desire \nthat the property be sold-off at the earliest so that they can enjoy the ir \napportioned shares. It is, therefore, in the interest of all partie s that \nthe  property  be  put  through  public auction and on  mo nies  \nrealised from  the  sale/ transfer  of rights, the  first  charge  shal l  be \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:14.12.2022\n19:21:12Signature Not Verified\nNIC No.2022/DHC/005545 \nEFA(OS) 1/2019   Page 7 of 7 \n towards stamp duty, which shall be deposited by the Cour t \nAuctioneer in the Registry of the court.   \n11. The learned counsel for the respondents submit that they will  \nrequest the learned executing court to appoint a Court Auctioneer.   \n12. The learned Senior Advocate for the respondent no.2 submits \nthat the lis is pending between the quarrelling siblings for the past \ndecade and half and they would request that the pending execu tion \nproceedings be disposed-off at the earliest.  The court is confiden t \nthat when such a request is made before the executing court, it will be \nduly considered.   \n13.

    "summary": "The appellants, Krishan Pal Mourya and others, appealed the award of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) dated 27‑03‑2018 which granted only Rs.50,000 as compensation on the ground that all claimants were adults and therefore not dependent on the deceased, Sh. Balak Ram. The accident involved a mini‑bus (DL‑1VA‑0384) driven at high speed, resulting in the death of the deceased. The appellants argued that the deceased's 18‑year‑old unmarried daughter was financially dependent and that the Tribunal erred in applying a nominal compensation. They relied on Supreme Court precedents (Sarla Verma, National Insurance Co. v. Birender) and a Punjab‑Haryana High Court decision (Oriental Insurance Co. v. Raj Rani) to establish dependency and appropriate quantum. The respondents contended that no documentary proof of the deceased’s income was produced. Justice Navin Chawla held that in the absence of income proof, the minimum wage for an unskilled worker (Rs.9,048 per month) should be used, applied a 10% future prospects factor, a half‑deduction for personal expenses, and a multiplier of 9, arriving at a loss‑of‑dependency award of Rs.5,37,500. Additional awards for loss of consortium, estate, and funeral expenses brought total compensation to Rs.7,27,500, less the Rs.50,000 already paid, resulting in enhanced compensation of Rs.6,77,500 with interest. The appeal was allowed and the enhanced amount ordered to be paid.",
    "facts": "The deceased, Sh. Balak Ram, a 56‑year‑old labourer, was walking with a companion when a mini‑bus (DL‑1VA‑0384) driven by respondent No.1 at high speed struck him, causing fatal injuries. The deceased was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. The claimants—his children and other relatives—filed a claim before the MACT. The Tribunal found the bus driver negligent but awarded only Rs.50,000, reasoning that the claimants were adults and not dependent on the deceased. The appellants challenged the quantum, asserting that the 18‑year‑old unmarried daughter was dependent and that the Tribunal failed to consider appropriate compensation heads.",
    "arguments": "Appellants: Asserted that the daughter (appellant No.4) was financially dependent, citing Sarla Verma and other Supreme Court rulings that unmarried daughters are presumed dependent. Requested compensation based on loss of dependency, loss of consortium, loss of estate, and funeral expenses. Submitted that in absence of income proof, minimum wages should be used for calculation. Respondents: Contended that no documentary evidence of the deceased’s income was produced, and therefore the Tribunal’s modest award was appropriate. Emphasized that the claimants were adults and not dependent.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "Justice Chawla examined precedent that dependency is not limited to minors; an unmarried daughter of 18 is presumed dependent. In the absence of income proof, the court adopted the minimum wage for an unskilled worker as the deceased’s earnings. Applying the 10% future prospects factor, a half‑deduction for personal expenses, and a multiplier of 9 (per Sarla Verma), the loss‑of‑dependency was calculated at Rs.5,37,500. The court further awarded loss of consortium, loss of estate, and funeral expenses as per Supreme Court guidance in Pranay Sethi and United India Insurance cases. Interest at 9% per annum was ordered, and the enhanced compensation was directed to be paid within six weeks.",

This appeal has been filed challenging the Award dated \n27.03.2018 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Impugned Award’) \npassed by the learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, (Pilot \nCourt), Karkardooma Courts, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as \nthe ‘Tribunal’)  in MACT No. 15441/15, titled Krishan Pal \nMourya & Ors. v. Ravinder Kumar & Ors .   \n2. It was the case of the claimants before the learned \nTribunal that their father, Sh.Balak Ram (hereinafter referred to \nas the ‘Deceased ’) along with one Nafees was going towards IT \nPark from Jamuna Khadar on foot. As they reached IT Park Red \nLight ISBT to Shastri Park Chowk, GT Road, Delhi, a mini bus \nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSigning Date:16.10.2023\n16:06:32Signature Not Verified\n                                                                                 \n  \nMAC.APP. 77/2019       Page 2 of 8 \n bearing registration no.DL-1VA-0384 (hererinafter referred to \nas the ‘Offending Vehicle’) , which was being driven by \nrespondent no.1 at a very high speed and in a rash and negligen t \nmanner, came from Kashmiri Gate side and hit the deceased. \nResultantly, the deceased fell down on the road and sustained \nfatal injuries. Though he was rushed to Dr. Jag Parvesh Chand \nHospital, Shastri Park by the CAT Ambulance, he was declared \nas brought dead.  \n3. The learned Tribunal, on appreciation of evidence led \nbefore it, came to a conclusion that the accident had taken place \ndue to the Offending Vehicle being driven in a rash and \nnegligent manner. However, on the quantum of compensation to \nbe awarded to the appellants, the learned Tribunal held that as  \nall the claimants were major, they could not be considered as \ndependent on the deceased and, therefore, awarded only a sum \nof Rs.50,000/- as compensation, relying upon the judgment of \nthe Supreme Court in Manjuri Bera v. Oriental Insurance Co. \nLtd., (2007) 10 SCC 643.  \n4. The limited challenge of the appellants to the Impugned \nAward is on the quantum of compensation awarded in their \nfavour.  \n5. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that the \nappellant no.4, the daughter of the deceased was aged only 18 \nyears and was unmarried. She was clearly dependent on the \nincome of the father, that is, the deceased. He submits that t he \nappellant no. 1 appeared before the learned Tribunal as PW-1, \nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSigning Date:16.10.2023\n16:06:32Signature Not Verified\n                                                                                 \n  \nMAC.APP. 77/2019       Page 3 of 8 \n and deposed that the appellants were dependent on the incom e \nof the deceased. He submits that in terms of the judgment of t he \nSupreme Court in Sarla Verma (Smt) and Others v. Delhi \nTransport Corporation and Another , (2009) 6 SCC 121, the \nappellant no. 4 would be dependent on the deceased and his \nincome, by deducting one half of the income of the deceased \ntowards personal expenses, should have been taken into \nconsideration for awarding the compensation to the appellants. \n6. On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent \nno.3 submits that there was no document filed by the appell ants \nto prove the income of the deceased.  \n7. I have considered the submissions made by the learned \ncounsels for the parties. \n8. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Birender , (2020) 11 \nSCC 356, the Supreme Court has held as under:-  \n“14. It is thus settled by now that the legal \nrepresentatives of the deceased have a right to \napply for compensation. Having said that, it \nmust necessarily follow that even the major \nmarried and earning sons of the deceased \nbeing legal representatives have a right to \napply for compensation and it would be the \nbounden duty of the Tribunal to consider the \napplication irrespective of the fact whether the \nlegal representative concerned was fully \ndependent on the deceased and not to limit the \nclaim towards conventional heads only. The \nevidence on record in the present case would \nsuggest that the claimants were working as \nagricultural labourers on contract basis and \nwere earning meagre income between Rs \n1,00,000 and Rs 1,50,000 per annum. In that \nsense, they were largely dependent on the \nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSigning Date:16.10.2023\n16:06:32Signature Not Verified\n                                                                                 \n  \nMAC.APP. 77/2019       Page 4 of 8 \n earning of their mother and in fact, were \nstaying with her, who met with an accident at \nthe young age of 48 years. ” \n9. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Raj Rani , 2022 SCC \nOnLine P&H 3673, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, \nwhile dealing with a similar issue, held as under:- \n“19. I find that though no fault can be found \nwith the observations by the Tribunal that \nclaimant Sanju Kumar could not be taken to be \ndependent upon earnings of the deceased for \nthe reason that he had attained majority but \nsame cannot be said to be true with regard to \nclaimant Shavnam, aged about 21 years, an \nunmarried daughter of the deceased. There is \nnothing on record to show that Shavnam is \nengaged in any avocation or has any source of \nincome. Therefore, she should have been taken \nto be dependent family member of the \ndeceased. As has been generally observed, an \nunmarried daughter of the age of 21 years is \nfinancially dependent upon her parents and \nrather father in most of the cases, for meeting \nher basis needs. Most girls in that age group \nare usually students and after completion of \nstudies, they are to be married off by the \nparents bearing the necessary expenses. \nTherefore, observing that Shavnam was not \nentitled for compensation is not the correct \nview taken by the Tribunal. The Tribunal has \nhowever found Smt. Raj Rani - widow and \nSumit minor son of the deceased to be \ndependent family members. ” \n10. As noted hereinabove, PW-1 Sh. Krishan Pal Maurya had \nstated that appellant no.4 was aged only 18 years and was \nunmarried as on the date of the accident. In terms of the above \njudgments, she would clearly be dependent on the deceased. \nThe learned Tribunal has, therefore, erred in not treating the \nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSigning Date:16.10.2023\n16:06:32Signature Not Verified\n                                                                                 \n  \nMAC.APP. 77/2019       Page 5 of 8 \n appellant no. 4 as dependent on the deceased and awarding los s \nof dependency in her favour.  \n11. As it would be a case of a single dependent, one half of \nthe income of the deceased would be deducted towards his \npersonal expenses. \n12. As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, the \nlearned counsel for the appellant is unable to show any \ndocument in proof of the claim of the income of the deceased. \nHe prays that the income of the deceased be determined on the \nbasis of the minimum wages notified by the Government of \nNCT of Delhi for an unskilled person as on the date of the \naccident. He submits that the same was Rs.9048/- per month.  \n13. I agree with the submission made by the learned counsel \nfor the appellants. In the absence of proof of income of the \ndeceased, as the deceased was claimed to be working as a \nlabourer, the minimum wages notified for an unskilled worker \nare to be adopted for determining his income.  \n14. Further, as the deceased was aged 56 years at the time of \nthe accident, in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in \nNational Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and \nOthers , (2017) 16 SCC 680, future prospects at the rate of 10% \nare to be considered. In addition, a multiplier of 9 is to be \napplied in terms of Sarla Verma (Supra), which has been \nreaffirmed in the judgement of Pranay Sethi  (supra).  \n15. In view of the above, the loss of dependency to be \nawarded to the appellants is determined as under:- \nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSigning Date:16.10.2023\n16:06:32Signature Not Verified\n                                                                                 \n  \nMAC.APP. 77/2019       Page 6 of 8 \n  \nS.No. Particulars Amounts \n1.

Over and above this, in terms of the judgment of the \nSupreme Court in  Pranay Sethi  (supra), and as explained by the \nSupreme Court in United India Insurance Company Limited v. \nSatinder Kaur alias Satwinder Kaur and Others , (2021) 11 \nSCC 780, the appellants are held entitled to compensation \ntowards loss of consortium of Rs.40,000/-x4= Rs.1,60,000/-; \nloss of estate Rs.15,000/-; and towards funeral expenses \nRs.15,000/-.  \n17. The total compensation, to which the appellants are held \nentitled, is as under:  \nS.No.  Particulars  Amounts  \n1.  Loss of Dependency Rs.5,37,500/- \n2.

The above enhanced compensation shall also carry \ninterest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of \nthe Claim Petition till realisation.  \n19. The Respondent no.3 has already deposited the \ncompensation of Rs.50,000/- along with interest with the \nlearned Tribunal. The Respondent no.3 shall deposit the \nenhanced amount along with interest, with the learned Tribunal \nwithin a period of six weeks from today.  \n20. The compensation assessed towards the loss of \ndependency shall be released only in favour of the appellant \nno.4.  As far as compensation on the other conventional heads  \nare concerned, the same shall be released equally in favour of \nthe appellants by the learned Tribunal.  \n21. As the accident took place in the year 2015 and more \nthan 8 years have passed, the entire compensation amount shall  \nbe released in favour of the appellants as a lump-sum. \n22.

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court examined an appeal filed by Tejpal Singh under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging a Single Judge’s order that partially modified an arbitral award arising from a collaboration agreement dated 03.05.2005 concerning a property at Model Town, Delhi. The respondent, Surinder Kumar Dewan, claimed ownership of the property and alleged that the appellant failed to complete construction, erected an unauthorized third floor, and caused demolition and sealing of the building, leading to multiple monetary claims (Claims A‑E). The appellant contested the authenticity of two collaboration agreements filed by the respondent, alleging forgery, while the respondent asserted the agreements were genuine. The arbitrator, after cross‑examination, concluded the appellant’s signatures on the documents were authentic, rejecting the forgery claim. The High Court upheld this finding, noting that the arbitrator’s view was a permissible interpretation of the evidence. Consequently, the Court affirmed the Single Judge’s decision to retain the award’s modifications, including the reduced monthly payment of Rs.35,000 and the upholding of other award directions. The appeal was dismissed, confirming the validity of the arbitration process and the authenticity of the collaboration agreement used as the basis for the award.",
    "facts": "The respondent owned property A‑2/5 (450 sq. yards) and entered into a collaboration agreement with the appellant on 03.05.2005 to demolish the existing structure and construct a new building. The agreement stipulated construction within 12 months, cost sharing, and allocation of floors. The appellant allegedly built an unauthorized third floor, leading to demolition by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and sealing of the property. The respondent terminated the agreement on 11.05.2007 and invoked the arbitration clause. The arbitrator awarded the respondent various monetary sums (Claims A‑E) for rent, damages, demolition costs, etc. The Single Judge later modified the award, setting aside Claim A and limiting Claim B to Rs.35,000 per month. The appellant appealed, challenging the authenticity of two agreements filed by the respondent and the award modification.",
    "arguments": "Appellant argued that the two collaboration agreements filed by the respondent were forged, citing discrepancies in signatures and cuttings. The respondent contended that the agreements were genuine, that the appellant had signed all pages, and that the arbitrator’s findings on authenticity were correct. The appellant also sought reversal of the Single Judge’s modification of the award. The respondent relied on the arbitrator’s acceptance of the agreements and the contractual obligations breached by the appellant, seeking enforcement of the award as modified.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the cross‑examination records and found that the appellant had admitted his signatures on the disputed agreement (Ex.CW‑1/C) and on the cuttings, undermining his claim of forgery. The arbitrator’s conclusion that the agreement was authentic was deemed a permissible view of the evidence. Consequently, the Court held that there was no ground to interfere with the arbitrator’s findings or the Single Judge’s partial modification of the award. The appeal was dismissed, confirming the award’s validity as modified.",

This appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Concilia tion Act, \n1996 ( in short ‘the Act’)  is directed against the impugned judgment and order \ndated 09.08.2018 passed by the learned Single Judge in OMP (COMM. ) \n178/2018, whereby the learned single judge has partially modifi ed the award to \nthe extent that amount awarded in favor of the respondent under Claim (A) w as \nset aside and the amount awarded under Claim (B) was restrict ed to \nRs.35,000/- per month for the period from May 2006 to 11.05.200 7 along with \ninterest as awarded by the learned Arbitrator.

While entering into the facts and circumstances related to the  \ncontroversy involved in the present appeal, it would be pr ofitable to \nrecapitulate the background and set up in which the dispute arose between the \nparties. The respondent (claimant before the learned arbitrator) bei ng the \nabsolute owner of the property bearing no. A-2/5 admeasuring 4 50 sq. yards, \nsituated at Model Town, Delhi, entered into the Collaboration Agreement with \nthe appellant on 03.05.2005, where under it was agreed that the e xisting \nstructure of the aforesaid property would be demolished and a new building \nwould be raised in conformity with the sanctioned plan a nd as per the \nspecification which were mutually discussed, agreed upon and  reduced into \nwriting.  \n \n3. Since one of the argument raised by the appellant before us is that th e \ntwo collaboration agreements filed by the respondent-claimant  before the \nlearned arbitrator are forged and fabricated whereas the one filed by the \nappellant is genuine, it is apt to deal with this argument at the outset to dispel \nthe doubt created as regard the authenticity of collaboration ag reements.  It is \nnoticed from the record that three different collaboration agreements were filed \nand exhibited before the learned arbitrator.   Two collaborations agreements i.e.  \nEx.CW1/2 and Ex. CW1/C were filed by the respondent-claimant; wh ereas  \nEx. RW6/A was filed by the appellant.   The learned arbitra tor has recorded \nthat the appellant had in his cross examination admitted th at he had signed \nevery page of Ex. CW-1/C and further admitted his signatures on th e \ncuttings/corrections made thereon except the cutting/correction made at point \n‘A’. The appellant had also stated that the signatures at point  ‘B’ appeared to \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:17.12.2022\n19:09:48Signature Not Verified\nN.C.No. 2022/DHC/005640 \nFAO(OS) (COMM) 8/2019     Page 3 of 22  \n be his but he had not signed the same. Thereafter, the learned arbit rator \ncompared the admitted signatures of the appellant with those appeari ng at the \ncuttings/corrections and the same were found to tally with one another. The \nlearned arbitrator has thus, concluded that once the appella nt had admitted his \nsignatures on Ex. CW-1/C, it did not lie in the mouth of the appellant to say \nthat Ex.CW-1/C as filed by the respondent-claimant was a forg ed and \nfabricated document.   The said findings of the learned arbitrato r do not call for \nany interference as the view taken by the learned arbitrator is a pos sible view \nof the evidence on record. The relevant findings of the learned arbit rator in this \nregard reads as under:- \n \n“11. It is undisputed case of the parties that claimant bei ng owner of the \nsubject property entered into a collaboration agreement wit h the \nrespondent for redevelopment and reconstruction of the property. \nHowever, there are three collaboration agreements availabl e on record - \ntwo agreement Ex. CW1/2 and Ex, CW 1/C filed by the claimant an d Ex. \nRW6/A filed by the respondent. According to respondent, the \ncollaboration agreements filed by the claimant are forged  and \nfabricated. \n \n12. It has come in the statement of claimant that origin ally respondent \nbrought one copy of the agreement but then he got the same photocopied \nand brought 5-6 copies of the same for signatures. Afte r he read the \nagreement, he found that certain conditions which were agreed  upon \nbetween by the parties were not incorporated in the agreement viz. the \nrespondent would be liable to penalty in case the properly was not \nconstructed within specified time and he would also pay r ent for his stay \nin another premises during the period the property was und er \nconstruction. Certain cuttings were therefore made in the agr eement and \nrespondent, in fact, in his own handwriting made such c uttings in \nagreement Ex. CW1/C. The agreement remained with the respondent an d \nclaimant was told by the respondent that whatever cuttings  have been \nmade in. Ex. CW 1/C would be made by him in the agreement which  was \ntyped on the stamp paper. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:ARUNA KANWAR\nSigning Date:17.12.2022\n19:09:48Signature Not Verified\nN.C.No. 2022/DHC/005640 \nFAO(OS) (COMM) 8/2019     Page 4 of 22  \n  \n13. Although, the respondent claimed that the collaborat ion agreement \nfiled by claimant is forged and fabricated, however, a per usal of the \nagreement Ex.

CW-1 /C has been \nsigned by him on every page. He also admitted that cuttings h ave also \nbeen signed by him except that the cutting at point „A‟ on internal page \nno.5 of the document does not appear to be his. Further s ignatures \nappearing at the said cutting at point „B‟ appears to b e his  but he had \nnot signed the same. This denial is of no consequence as his signatures \nwere also taken and the same tallies with the signature appe aring on the \ncuttings. Under the circumstances, having admitted his signa tures on \nEx.CW 1/C and the cuttings appearing on this document, ther e is no \nsubstance in the plea of the respondent that the claim of the claimant is \nbased on a forged and fabricated document. That being s o, the \nauthorities relied upon by the respondent in this re gard does not help \nhim. \n \n4. In view of the above position, it is the collaboration agreement  dated \n03.05.2005, Ex. CW-1/C, which has been treated as principal  and authentic \ndocument and accordingly the disputes between the parties have b een decided \nby the arbitrator and the learned Single Judge in light of th e terms contained \ntherein.  \n \n5. As per the collaboration agreement dated 03.05.2005, Ex. CW-1/ C, the \nconstruction was to be raised and completed by the appellan t within a period of \n12 months from the date of signing the agreement.  The enti re cost of \nconstruction along with other expenses were to be borne by the appellant. The \nappellant was further liable to pay an amount of Rs.30 lacs t o the respondent, \nbesides the cost of construction and other related expenses, of w hich Rs. 22 \nlacs were paid at the time of signing of the agreement and the balan ce Rs. 8 \nlacs would be paid at the time of laying the lantor  of the first floor.

It is not in dispute that as per the approved sanctioned  plan, construction \ncould be raised only up to the second floor but the appella nt not only raised \nunauthorized construction on each floor but also constructed  an additional floor \ni.e., third floor, which was totally unauthorized. The illeg al third floor and \nunauthorized portion on each floor was demolished by the Muni cipal \nCorporation of Delhi and the building was sealed. \n  \n7. However, when the building was de-sealed for removing un-auth orized \nconstruction, the appellant instead of getting the unautho rized portions \nregularized again started construction of third floor. Thereaf ter, the Municipal \nCorporation of Delhi sealed the entire property on 30.05.2006  and an FIR No. \n609/2006 was registered at P.S. Model Town against the responde nt at the \ninstance of the MCD.  The respondent applied for an anticipatory bai l but in \nview of the stand taken by the officials of the MCD that unaut horized \nconst ruction was still on, the respondent’s bail application was rej ected by the \nSessions Court.  Eventually, the anticipatory bail was gra nted to the respondent \nby this Court’s order on 07.02.2007.   In the given circumstances, the \nrespondent terminated the Collaboration Agreement through a leg al notice \ndated 11.05.2007 and invoked the arbitration clause.

    "summary": "International Tractors Ltd appealed against the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal’s order remanding its claims for deduction under Section 80JJAA and prior‑period expenses to the Assessing Officer (AO). The appellant argued that the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)] was empowered by Section 250(4) to entertain fresh claims and that the Tribunal’s direction to re‑verify the claims violated procedural law, particularly Rule 46A, which the appellant claimed was inapplicable because the evidence was produced by the CIT(A) and not the assessee. The revenue contended that the claims were invalid as the statutory accountant’s report required under Section 80JJAA was absent at the time of filing, justifying the Tribunal’s remand. The Court examined the factual matrix, the statutory provisions, and precedents such as Smt. Prabhavati S. Shah v. CIT, B.L. Choudhury v. CIT, and Goetze (India) Ltd v. CIT. It held that the CIT(A) had correctly exercised its powers under Section 250(4) and that the Tribunal’s remand was unnecessary. Consequently, the appeal was disposed of in favour of the appellant, setting aside the Tribunal’s order and directing that the deductions be allowed as per the CIT(A)’s findings.",

The AO rejected both claims, leading to an appeal before the CIT(A), which allowed the claims. The revenue appealed to the Tribunal, which upheld the CIT(A)’s allowance but remanded the matter to the AO for fresh verification and an opportunity of hearing.",
    "arguments": "Appellant (International Tractors Ltd) argued that the CIT(A) was empowered by Section 250(4) to make fresh inquiries and that Rule 46A did not apply because the evidence was produced by the CIT(A), not the assessee. Revenue argued that the absence of the accountant’s report at the time of filing made the claim invalid under the pre‑amendment provisions of Section 80JJAA and that the Tribunal was correct in directing re‑verification by the AO.",

It found that Rule 46A was inapplicable where the CIT(A) itself directed the evidence, distinguishing it from the procedural requirements applicable to the assessee. The Court also noted that the revenue’s reliance on the pre‑amendment requirement was misplaced, as the CIT(A)’s order was issued after the amendment and complied with the statutory conditions.

This is an appeal directed against the order of the Tribun al dated \n23.07.2018 passed in ITA No.5756/Del/2013 concerning the ass essment \nyear [in short ‘AY’] 2007 -2008.   \n5. Pithily put, the assessee is aggrieved by the impugned order passed by \nthe Tribunal, for the reason, that the Tribunal has remanded the matter to the \nAO to verify the details of the claims placed by the assess ee before the \nCIT(A) and allow the same, subject to satisfaction.  The direction of remand \nissued by the Tribunal is accompanied with a further direction t hat, before \nthe AO reaches any conclusion, he shall give the assessee an opportunity \nhearing and only thereafter, decide the issue, as per the facts obtain ing in the \ncase and, in accordance with the law. \nBackdrop:  \n6. Before we proceed further, what is required to be noticed is the \nfollowing broad facts:  \n6.1 The assessee claims that he is engaged in the business  of \nmanufacturing and assembling tractors and tractor components.   \n6.2 On 30.10.2007, the assessee filed the return qua AY 2007-2008 \nwherein it declared its taxable income as Rs.147,83,25,740/-.  Co ncededly, \nthe assessee while filing its return of income had failed to cla im the \ndeduction both under Section 80JJAA of the Act and qua prior period \nexpenses.  Insofar as the deduction under Section 80JJAA of the Ac t was \nconcerned, the amount was pegged at Rs.1,07,33,164/- whereas insofar as  \ndeduction qua prior period expenses was involved, the amount was \nquantified at Rs.51,21,024.  These deductions were claimed by t he assessee \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:22.04.2021\n09:35:56Signature Not Verified\nITA 35/2019  Page 3 of 13 \n before the AO by way of a statement/communication dated 14.12.2 009 filed \nwith him.  This statement, admittedly, was accompanied by a Ch artered \nAccountant's report in the prescribed form [i.e., Form 10DA].  Fur thermore, \nthe details concerning prior period expenses were also provided b y the \nassessee. \n6.3 The AO, however, declined to entertain the two deductions cl aimed \nby the assessee, i.e., under Section 80JJA of the Act and vis-à-vis prior \nperiod expenses. The AO, thus, assessed the assessee's taxable income at \nRs.148,24,34,100/- vide assessment order dated 29.12.2009.  The ass essee, \nbeing aggrieved, lodged an appeal with the CIT(A) on 27.01.2010. \n6.4. The CIT(A) vide order dated 30.08.2013 allowed the appeal of the \nassessee.  This time revenue was aggrieved and thus, went up in  appeal to \nthe Tribunal against the order of the CIT(A). The Tribunal vide the \nimpugned order, as noted above, remanded the matter to the AO.  \nPertinently, the Tribunal, while remaining the matter, has observed i n \nparagraph 17 of the impugned order that the CIT(A) was right in l aw in \nentertaining the fresh claims made by the assessee, in respect of the \naforesaid deductions, i.e., claim under Section 80JJAA of the  Act and the \nclaim concerning prior period expenses. \nSubmissions of Counsel:  \n7. Mr. Satyen Sethi, who appears on behalf of the assessee, has, broad ly, \nadvanced the following submissions:  \n7.1. That the CIT(A) has, in effect, exercised powers under Section 250(4) \nof the Act. In other words, according to Mr. Sethi, the CIT (A) was we ll \nwithin his powers to make further inquiry into the matter, and since, such \ninquiry had been made and the two claims in issue had been  allowed, there \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:22.04.2021\n09:35:56Signature Not Verified\nITA 35/2019  Page 4 of 13 \n was no necessity of remanding the matter to the AO for carrying out a fresh \ninquiry. \n7.2. The observation of the Tribunal that the AO had not been given an \nopportunity, to respond to the evidence considered by the CIT (A), was \nunnecessary in the facts of the case, as it was the CIT(A) who had calle d for \nthe information concerning the fresh claims made by the assessee, and \ntherefore, the question of giving an opportunity to the AO did not arise  \n7.3. In other words, the contention was that Rule 46A of the I ncome Tax \nRules, 1962 [in short 'the Rules'] had no applicability in the instant case.  In \nsum, the argument was that it was not the assessee who had pro duced the \nadditional evidence in support of its claim but it was the CIT (A) who had \ndirected the production of material, and therefore, the procedure pr escribed \nunder Rule 46A of the Rules was not required to be adhered to.   This apart, \nMr. Sethi also relied upon sub-rule 4 of Rule 46A to contend that the said \nsub-rule is an exception to the procedure prescribed under sub-rules 1 to 3 of \nthe said rule and that the said sub-rule empowered the CIT(A), to  direct \nproduction of evidence, i.e., documents and witnesses, etc., f or disposal of \nthe appeal. \n7.4. In support of his submission that the provision of Sect ion 250(4) of \nthe Act is distinct from the provisions contained in sub-ru les 1 to 3 of Rule \n46A of the Rules, Mr. Sethi placed reliance on the judgment of th e Bombay \nHigh Court rendered in Smt. Prabhavati S. Shah v. CIT, [1998] 231 ITR 1 \n(Bombay)  as also the judgment of the Orissa High Court rendered in B.L. \nChoudhury v. CIT, [1976] 105 ITR 371 (Orissa) . \n8. On the other hand, Mr. Ajit Sharma, who appears on behalf of the \nrevenue, relied upon the order of the Tribunal as well as that of the A O.  Mr. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:22.04.2021\n09:35:56Signature Not Verified\nITA 35/2019  Page 5 of 13 \n Sharma contended that sub-section 2 of Section 80JJAA of the Ac t, as it \nstood before its amendment via Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. 01.04.2017 (clause \nb of sub-section 2 of section 80JJAA), mandated that no deduction could be \nclaimed in respect of employment of new employees unless the assessee \nfurnished, along with the return of income, the report of the acco untant.  \nTherefore, the contention advanced was that, since the return had b een filed \nwithout the report of the accountant, the Tribunal had, rightly , remanded the \nmatter to the AO for carrying out the necessary inquiry as to wheth er or not \nthe claim under Section 80JJAA was viable.  Likewise, in respect  of the \nclaim of deduction qua prior period expenses, Mr. Sharma said all that the \nTribunal had done was, to direct the verification of the claim, in line with \nthe evidence produced by the assessee before the CIT(A).  \nReasons and Analysis:  \n9. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused th e \nrecord.  As indicated in the opening, what is not in dispute are the following \nfacts: \n(i) The assessee had not made the claims, under Section 80JJA of the Act \nand qua prior period expenses, in the original return.  \n(ii). The assessee did not move the AO with a revised return fo r claim ing \ndeductions under Section 80JJAA of the Act and for prior period expenses. \n(iii) The assessee for the first time made these claims before the AO  by \nway of a statement/communication dated 14.12.2009. The said \ncommunication was, concededly, accompanied by the auditor's report \nprepared in the prescribed form and also contained details of the prior peri od \nexpenses. \n(iv) The AO while framing the assessment declined to entertain  these \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:22.04.2021\n09:35:56Signature Not Verified\nITA 35/2019  Page 6 of 13 \n claims on the ground that they did not either form part of th e original return \nor the revised return.  In support of his approach, the AO ha s placed reliance \non the judgment of the Supreme Court rendered in Goetze (India) Ltd v. \nCIT, (2006) 284 ITR 323 (SC).  \n(v) However, the CIT(A) ruled that the fresh claims made by the assess ee \ncould be entertained, and in this context, relied upon the ju dgments of \nvarious Courts and Tribunals. \n(vi) The CIT(A) thereafter, examined the evidence placed on record by the \nassessee concerning both the claims, i.e., deductions claimed un der Section \n80JJAA of the Act and for prior period expenses. The discussion concerning \nthese two claims are set out in paragraphs 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 of th e CIT(A)'s \norder. \n(vi) The Tribunal via the impugned order, while sustaining the view taken \nby the CIT(A) that a fresh claim could be entertained by it, has remanded the \nmatter to the AO, as indicated above, for a fresh verification in res pect of \nboth the claims. \n10. Given the foregoing, what is required to be noticed is that under \nSection 80JJAA of the Act, the assessee claimed a deduction am ounting to \nRs.1,07,33,164/- while in respect of the prior period claim, the as sessee \nclaimed a deduction amounting to Rs.51,21,024/-. The CIT(A), how ever, \nallowed the deduction qua prior period expenses, only to the extent of \nRs.25,40,305/-.  The remaining amount was disallowed largely on  the \nground that expenses had been incurred to the extent of Rs.2 4,78,391/- \nwithout deduction of withholding tax.  There were also cert ain expenses of a \ncumulative value of  Rs.1,02,328/- which were disallowed, for the reason \nthat they did not concern the period in issue, i.e., AY 2007-2008. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VIPIN KUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:22.04.2021\n09:35:56Signature Not Verified\nITA 35/2019  Page 7 of 13 \n 11. Therefore, it would be relevant, for the moment, to extract her eafter, \nwhat is it, that was put before the AO along with the \nstatement/communication dated 14.12.2009: \n“1. Claim of deduction under section 80JJAA of Rs.l,07,33,l64/ - \n- this deduction is claimed on account of employment give n to new \nworkmen. The claim is duly supported with the report issued  in \nForm 10DA read with Rule 19AB and duly certified by the  \nchartered accountant. A copy of the report issued under sectio n \n80JJAA is also enclosed herewith for your ready reference and \nperusal. \n \n2. Claim of expenditure of Rs.5l,21,024/- - These expendi tures \nare accounted for in the books of account of the subsequ ent FY \n2008-09 (AY 2007-08). A list of all these expenditures, called as \nprior period expenses, is enclosed herewith. However all  these \nexpenditure relate to FY 2006-07 i.e. AY 2007-08. \n \n3.

But no tax was deducted at sou rce in \nAY 2007-08. As such these  expenditure of Rs.24,78,391/- were \ndisallowed under section 40(a)(ia) on account of non deduc tion of \ntax at source.”  \n \n11.1. The AO, while framing the assessment, simply, declined to look a t the \nmaterial placed before him and ",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court, on 20 September 2021, heard MAC.APP.134/2019, an application filed by Ratan Majumdar (appellant) seeking a remit to the tribunal to lead additional evidence concerning his permanent disability and academic status. The appellant challenged the award dated 11 September 2018 on the ground that a disability certificate was not available at the time of the award and that his educational records, necessary for assessing future loss of income, were missing. The Court noted that the Medical Superintendent of Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital had, on 5 February 2019, forwarded a disability certificate indicating a 40% permanent disability of the appellant's lower limbs. The appellant also produced his educational documents thereafter. The Court observed that the original award made no reference to permanent disability or future loss of income and had assessed income on the basis of unskilled workers' minimum wage. Consequently, the Court set aside the impugned award, remitted the matter to the tribunal to consider the new evidence, and directed that the tribunal pass a fresh award, taking into account the amount already released and the certified disability certificate. The appeal was disposed of in the appellant's favour.",
    "facts": "The appellant, Ratan Majumdar, was awarded compensation on 11‑09‑2018 by a tribunal concerning a motor accident. At the time of the award, a disability certificate was not available because the appellant had not been examined by a disability board. Subsequent directions by the Court on 22‑01‑2019 led to the formation of a medical board, which on 5‑02‑2019 issued a certificate confirming 40% permanent disability of the appellant's lower limbs. The appellant also later produced his educational records, which were absent during the original award. The original award did not discuss permanent disability or future loss of income and used a benchmark of minimum wage for unskilled workers to assess monthly income.",
    "arguments": "The appellant argued that the absence of a disability certificate and educational records at the time of the award rendered the compensation assessment incomplete and that the tribunal should reassess compensation, including future loss of income, based on the newly submitted evidence. The appellant contended that the tribunal erred by not considering permanent disability and by using an inappropriate wage benchmark. The respondents did not contest the submission of the disability certificate but raised no substantive objection to the remand.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva held that the lack of consideration of permanent disability and future loss of income in the original award constituted a material omission. The newly submitted disability certificate (40% permanent disability) and educational records warranted a fresh assessment. Accordingly, the award dated 11‑09‑2018 was set aside, and the matter was remitted to the tribunal to lead additional evidence and pass a fresh award, taking into account the amount already released and the certified disability certificate.",

Learned counsel for the appellant submits that at t he time when \nthe impugned judgment was passed , the disability certificate was not \navailable as the claimant has not been examined by a disability board.   \n \n3. Learned counsel submits that by order dated 22.01.2019  in CM \nAPPL. 3120//2019 , this Court had directed the Medical \nSuperintendent of Jag Parvesh Chandra Hospital to constitute a \nmedical board to assess the permanent disability of  the appellant , if \nany and to submit a rep ort to this Court.   \n \n4.

It is noticed from the impugned award that ther e is no \ndiscussion with regard to the permanent disability or grant of future \nloss of income, if any, to the appellant.  \n \n7. The tribunal has also noticed in the award that the re was no \nrecord produced with regard to his academic status and accordingly \nthe mo nthly income was notionally assessed on the benchma rk of \nprevalent minimum wage of unskilled workers.  \n \n8. Since as per the medical examination of the medical board, \nappellant has sustained 40% permanent disability in  relation to both \nhis lower limbs , in my view, it is a fit case for a remit to the tribunal \nto assess the compensation with regard to future lo ss of income. \nFurther , since appellant claims to have traced out the educat ional \ndocuments, tribunal shall also revisit the award based on evid ence tha t \nmay be produced by the appellant  and reassess the income , if so \nwarranted.  \n \n9.

    "summary": "The appellant Nadeem appealed against a trial‑court judgment dated 10 September 2018 that convicted him of murder under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment and a fine. The incident concerned the killing of his wife Shabana on the night of 10‑11 April 2012 at their residence in Sarai Mahal, Delhi, allegedly by thrusting a screwdriver into her head. The prosecution relied on the statements of several witnesses, including two primary eye‑witnesses (PW‑3 and PW‑6) who later turned hostile, medical evidence establishing a homicidal death, and testimonies establishing motive and prior quarrels. The appellant contended that the hostile witnesses rendered the case purely circumstantial, lacking direct evidence such as a last‑seen statement, recovery of the weapon, or fingerprints, and argued that the trial court’s reliance on Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act was erroneous. The prosecution countered that the appellant failed to produce a credible alibi and that the cumulative evidence, including motive, medical findings, and corroborative family testimonies, satisfied the burden of proof. The appellate bench examined the admissibility and weight of the hostile testimonies, the applicability of Sections 106 and 313 CrPC, and relevant precedents. Ultimately, the court upheld the trial‑court’s conviction, finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the murder charge.",
    "facts": "On 10‑11 April 2012, Shabana was found dead at her Delhi residence with a screwdriver wound to the head. Police were alerted by PW‑6 (Abrar Mirza) after PW‑3 (Ballu Qureshi) reported the incident. The deceased’s family members testified to cohabitation with the appellant and a history of violent quarrels. Medical examination confirmed a homicidal death. The appellant claimed he was sleeping at home until his arrest on 11 April and presented an alibi witness (DW‑1).",
    "arguments": "Appellant argued that the two primary eye‑witnesses turned hostile, leaving only circumstantial evidence without direct proof, and that reliance on Section 106 Indian Evidence Act was improper. He cited Mangu Singh v. Dharmendra, Reena Hazarika v. State of Assam, and Md. Yunis Ali Tarafdar v. State of West Bengal. Prosecution maintained that the cumulative evidence—hostile but still admissible testimonies, medical proof, motive, prior complaints, and failure to produce a credible alibi—satisfied the burden of proof, and that the appellant bore the onus under Section 106 to explain the circumstances.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The bench held that hostile witness statements, while diminishing probative value, do not render evidence inadmissible if corroborated by other material. The medical evidence established homicide, and the series of family testimonies demonstrated motive and prior threats. The appellant’s alibi was discredited by the investigating officer’s testimony. Applying the principles of Sections 106 and 313 CrPC, the court concluded that the prosecution had discharged the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and the conviction was upheld.",

According to the \nprosecution, a call was made to the Control Room, Police  Headquarters \nat about 2:03:35 a.m. on 11th April, 2012 by PW-6 Abrar Mirza from his \nmobile.  The said information was recorded in PCR form Ex .PW-26/A \nby W/Constable Pooja PW-26.  The deceased was removed to the \nhospital by the PCR van where she was declared brought dea d.  The \ninvestigation was assigned to PW-11 SI Md. Faiyaz who alo ngwith \npolice officers PW-27 and PW-24, reached the spot and found one  eye \nwitness PW-3 Ballu Qureshi present.  As per the prosecution,  the said \neye witness informed that the appellant had murdered the deceas ed and \non the basis of the statement of PW-3, Rukka  was prepared and \nthereafter the investigation was entrusted to PW-36 Inspector  I.K.

The appellant ple aded not \nguilty and claimed trial.  The prosecution examined 36 witne sses in \nsupport of the case, the statement of the appellant was rec orded under \nSection 313 Cr.P.C. and the appellant led the evidence of one w itness in \ndefence.\nSubmissions by Appellant:\n3. The appellant through his appeal and arguments on his behalf by \ncounsel submitted that both public witnesses PW-3 and PW-6 had t urned \nhostile and therefore it was not a case of direct eye witn ess testimony \nbeing available and could only be proved on circumstantial evid ence.  \nHowever, even on circumstantial evidence, there was no last  seen \nevidence, no recovery and no chance prints which ought to imp licate the \nappellant for the crime.

Th e \nbasis of conviction by the learned Trial Court was Section 10 6 of the \nIndian Evidence Act which was contrary to law and in support of this the \ncounsel for the appellant relied upon inter alia Mangu Singh v. \nDharmendra and Anr.  (2015) 17 SCC 488, Reena Hazarika v. State of \nAssam  (2019) 13 SCC 289, Md. Yunis Ali Tarafdar v. State of West \nBengal  (2020) Vol. 3 SCC 747.\nSubmissions by the Prosecution:\n4. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor on behalf of the prosecut ion \nsubmitted that the appellant was rightly convicted sinc e there was not \nonly medical evidence available but also eye witness testi mony, proof of \nmotive and conduct of the appellant prior to the incident a nd other links \nin the chain of evidence.  Learned APP submitted that the a ppellant and \nthe deceased cohabited in the same house where the murde r took place \nright till the time of the incident as husband and wife a nd therefore the \nburden shifted upon the appellant under Section 106 of the Indian \nEvidence Act to present an alibi or otherwise explain the circumstances \nagainst him.  The appellant did present an alibi by examin ing DW-1 who \ndeposed that the appellant was sleeping “ in the home ” between 10:30 \np.m. on 10th April, 2012 right up till his arrest at 10:00 a.m. on 11th\nApril, 2012, which is completely falsified by the testimo ny of the IO \nPW-36 who deposed that when he went and searched the appellant on  \n11th April, 2012, he was not found at that house.  Motive of th e appellant \nto kill the deceased was fully established by the tes timonies of family \nmembers of the deceased ( inter alia  PW-5, PW-7, PW-9, PW-10, PW-\n12, PW-13, PW-20) who had deposed as to the multiple and se rious \nquarrels between the appellant and deceased.  PW-7 had also  deposed \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003481\nCRL.A.77/2019 Page 4 of 14 that the appellant had threatened to kill the deceased 3-4 days before the \nincident but was not cross-examined by the appellant.  P W-12 and PW-\n20 had deposed that 2 days prior to the incident, the app ellant was \narrested/apprehended by the police on a complaint made by t he deceased \nafter a quarrel.  Learned APP further submitted that the m edical \nevidence established that the death was homicidal and could  not have \nbeen suicidal.\nThe Evidence:\n5. The evidence, which is relevant and necessary for proper \nappreciation of the contentions of the parties, as gleane d from the record, \nis as under:\n(i) PW-3 Ballu Qureshi was cited as the informant and eye witness \nwho turned hostile.  In his deposition he stated that he  was residing in \nKothri no.3 in Premises no.1166, Sarai Mahal, Churiwalan, Jama \nMasjid, Delhi-06.  As per PW-3 around 2:00 a.m. when he wa s sleeping \nin his room, two people came and knocked on his door and mention ed \nabout an incident with Shabana and he therefore accompanied t he \npersons to the house of Shabana, which was some distance fr om his \nhouse.  They discovered that Shabana was lying on bed and uppe r \nportion of her body was on the bed and legs were touching the floor and \nshe had injury marks on the head near the ear which appeared t o be \ncaused by a screw driver.  When he rushed outside in a perplex ed \ncondition he met one Abrar and asked him to call the police.   In his \ncross-examination by the learned APP he was confronted with hi s \nstatement given to the police (PW-3/A) from which he was a llegedly \nresiling.  He denied that he had stated that when he wen t to the room of \nShabana or that Nadeem was sitting on Shabana on the bed and  saying \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003481\nCRL.A.77/2019 Page 5 of 14 that he will finish daily quarrel forever.

He noticed PW-3 who was \nraising hue and cry about a lady lying in the said house wi th a screw \ndriver injury and thereupon he made a call to the PCR.  Since he was \nresiling from his previous statement, the learned APP cro ss-examined \nhim when he confirmed that it was PW-3 that told him that  the deceased \nhad been inflicted an injury by husband (the appellant) wi th the help of \nscrew driver and he had run away.  Later in his cross-examinati on, he \nagain contradicted himself and denied the fact that he was s o informed \nby PW-3 and he confirmed that he himself had not witnessed t he \nincident. \n(iii) PW-5 Saba, the daughter of the deceased, in her tes timony \nconfirmed that her mother was residing with the appellant at that \nChuriwalan address and that the appellant used to meet he r mother and \ndemand money from her and had threatened her in the past.

    "summary": "The Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr filed a Regular First Appeal (RFA) seeking condonation of a 1,150‑day delay in filing an appeal against a decree dated 17‑09‑2015 in Civil Suit No. 1090/2013. The appellants argued that the delay was due to a genuine belief that the suit would be transferred to the Calcutta High Court because of territorial jurisdiction issues, and that they only learned of the decree when execution proceedings were initiated in 2017. The respondents contended that the appellants offered no sufficient cause, relying on precedents that stress strict adherence to limitation periods. The Delhi High Court examined Section 5 of the Limitation Act, the doctrine of substantial justice, and several Supreme Court decisions interpreting \"sufficient cause\". The Court emphasized that condonation is discretionary, requires a showing of sufficient cause, and must balance technical limitation rules against the ends of justice. Applying these principles, the Court found the appellants’ belief to be bona‑fide and not deliberate, and consequently allowed the condonation of delay, permitting the appeal to proceed on its merits.",
    "facts": "The appellants, Kolkata Municipal Corporation & Anr, were parties to Civil Suit No. 1090/2013. A decree was passed on 17‑09‑2015. Believing the case would be transferred to the Calcutta High Court due to jurisdictional concerns, they did not file an appeal. They only became aware of the decree when an execution petition was filed in March 2017. An application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC to set aside the ex‑parte decree was dismissed on 05‑10‑2018. The regular first appeal was finally filed in December 2018, resulting in a delay of 1,150 days.",
    "arguments": "Appellants: The delay was caused by a genuine, bona‑fide belief that the suit would be transferred to the Calcutta High Court; there was no intentional or negligent delay; they sought condonation under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Respondents: The appellants failed to show sufficient cause; reliance on erroneous legal advice does not constitute material grounds; the delay should be dismissed per established precedent.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the purpose of limitation statutes—preventing stale claims—and the discretionary power under Section 5 to condone delay when sufficient cause is shown. It cited Supreme Court jurisprudence emphasizing substantial justice, the elastic nature of \"sufficient cause,\" and the need for a pragmatic, non‑pedantic approach. The Court held that the appellants’ belief about jurisdictional transfer, though mistaken, was made in good faith and not a product of deliberate neglect. Consequently, the Court exercised its discretion to condone the delay, allowing the appeal to be heard on its merits.",

The appellants filed the present application under Section 5 of \nLimitation Act, 1963 for condonation of delay of 1150 days i n filing \npresent appeal. The appellants pleaded that appellant no. 1 di d not \nparticipate in the proceedings pertaining to suit no. 1090/2 013 under \ngenuine belief that the case would be transferred to the High C ourt of \nCalcutta due to lack of territorial jurisdiction in court at D elhi. The \nappellants came to know about passing of the judgment and decree  \ndated 17.05.2015 on 08.03.2017 in execution petition no 5  of 2017 \nwhich was preferred by the respondent no. 1 before High Court of \nCalcutta when the appellants received notice of said execution \nproceedings. The appellants filed an application bearing IA No . \n4956/2016 under Order IX Rule 13 CPC for setting aside the ex-parte  \njudgment and decree dated 17.09.2015 which was dismissed by  the \nlearned Single Judge vide judgment dated 05.10.2018. The ap pellants \nalso decided to prefer the Regular First Appeal (RFA) which was \naccordingly prepared by the counsel for the appellants and draft of \nRFA was sent to the concerned department for vetting and signi ng of \nthe affidavits in the month of November, 2018. The appeal was fi led \nin December, 2018. The delay on part of the appellants in filing \npresent appeal was owing to genuine and bona fide  belief that the suit \nwould be transferred to the High Court of Calcutta due to lack  of \nterritorial jurisdiction in court at Delhi. The delay of 1150  days was \nneither intentional nor deliberate. It was prayed that delay of 1 150 \ndays in filing present appeal be condoned. \n3. The respondent no. 1 submitted that the appellants did n ot show \nsufficient cause for condonation of delay of 1150 days in filing pre sent \nDigitally Signed\nBy:HARVINDER KAUR\nBHATIA\nSigning Date:05.07.2022\n16:59:49Signature Not Verified\n \n  \nRFA(OS) 8/2019                          Page 3 of 35  \n appeal but took flimsy ground of wrong legal advice for cond onation \nof delay which is lacking material particulars. The application for  \ncondonation of delay is without any merit and be dismiss ed. The \nrespondent no. 1 relied on Popat Bahiri Govardhane &  Others V \nSpecial Land Acquisition  Officer &  Another,  2013 (10) SCC 765 ;  \nOffice of  the Chief Post Master General &  Others V  Living \nMedia Ltd &  Another, AIR 2012 SC  1506 and The State of \nMadhya Pradesh &  Others V Bherulal, 2020 (10) SCC 654. \n4. The Law of limitation is based on equitable princip le that a \nlitigant should be prompt in claiming the relief in  legal \nproceedings and is required to bury acts of the past whic h become \nstale due to lapse of time and have not been agitated withi n time. \nSection 3 of the Act, provides that every suit, appeal and applicat ion if \nfiled or instituted after the prescribed period is liable to be di smissed \nalthough limitation has not been set up as a defence. Section 5  of the \nAct deals with the extension of prescribed period of limitat ion. The \nCourt with discretionary jurisdiction can condone the delay and  \nproceed with the case if concerned party furnishes sufficient cause f or \ndelay in institution of appeal and application. Section 5  of the \nLimitation Act reads as under:- \n5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases. —Any \nappeal or any application, other than an application under \nany of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil \nProcedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), may be admitted after the \nprescribed period, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the \ncourt that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal \nor making the application within such period.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:HARVINDER KAUR\nBHATIA\nSigning Date:05.07.2022\n16:59:49Signature Not Verified\n \n  \nRFA(OS) 8/2019                          Page 4 of 35  \n Explanation. — The fact that the appellant or the applicant \nwas misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High \nCourt in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period may \nbe sufficient cause within the meaning of this section. \n \n5. The ter m “sufficient cause” as appearing in Section 5 of the Act \nis not defined and is required to be interpreted to advance cau se of \njustice. The Supreme Court in Ramlal, Motilal and Chhotelal V \nRewa Coalfields Ltd, 1962 SCR (3) 762 connected Section 5 of the \nAct with doctrine of substantial justice and observed as under:- \nIn construing S.5, it is relevant to bear in mind two important \nconsiderations. The first consideration is that the expiration of \nthe period of limitation prescribed for making an appeal gives \nrise to a right in favour of the decree-holder to treat the decree \nas binding between the parties. In other words, when the \nperiod of limitation prescribed has expired the decree-holder \nhas obtained a benefit under the law of limitation to treat the \ndecree as beyond challenge, and this legal right which has \naccrued to the decree-holder by lapse of time should not be \nlight-heartedly disturbed. The other consideration which \ncannot be ignored is that if sufficient cause for excusing delay \nis shown discretion is given to the Court to condone delay and \nadmit the appeal. This discretion has been deliberately \nconferred on the Court in order that judicial power and \ndiscretion in that behalf should be exercised to advance \nsubstantial justice.  \n6. The Supreme Court in  Collector Land Acquisition V Mst. \nKatiji & others, 1987 SCR (2) 387 observed that the legislature has \nconferred the power to condone delay by enacting Section 5 of the \nLimitation Act in order to enable the Courts to do substantial ju stice to \nparties by disposing of matters on merits. The expression “sufficient \ncause ” is adequately elastic to enable the Courts to apply the law in a \nDigitally Signed\nBy:HARVINDER KAUR\nBHATIA\nSigning Date:05.07.2022\n16:59:49Signature Not Verified\n \n  \nRFA(OS) 8/2019                          Page 5 of 35  \n meaningful manner which sub-serves the ends of justice which is \nbeing the life-purpose for the existence of the institution of Co urts. \nThe Supreme Court laid down certain principles which need to be  \nfollowed while employing doctrine of condonation of delay wh ich are \nas under:- \n1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an \nappeal late. \n2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious \nmatter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of \njustice being defeated. As against this when delay is condoned \nthe highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided \non merits after hearing the parties. \n3. \"Every day's delay must be explained\" does not mean that a \npedantic approach should be made. Why not every hour's \ndelay, every second's delay? The doctrine must be applied in a \nrational common sense pragmatic manner. \n4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are \npitted against each other, cause of substantial justice deserves \nto be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested \nright in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. \n5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned \ndeliberately, or on account of culpable negligence, or on \naccount of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by \nresorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk. \n6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on \naccount of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds \nbut because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected \nto do so. \n7.  It must be noted that no party can claim condonation of del ay \neven if sufficient cause has been made out in the facts of a give n case. \nIt was held in Ramlal, Motilal and Chhotelal V Rewa Coalfields \nLtd. as under:- \nDigitally Signed\nBy:HARVINDER KAUR\nBHATIA\nSigning Date:05.07.2022\n16:59:49Signature Not Verified\n \n  \nRFA(OS) 8/2019                          Page 6 of 35  \n It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after \nsufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the \ncondonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The \nproof of a sufficient cause is a condition precedent for the \nexercise of the discretionary jurisdiction vested in the court by \nS. 5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be \ndone; the application for condoning delay has to be dismissed \non that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the \nCourt has to enquire whether in its discretion it should \ncondone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally \nintroduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at \nthis stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall \nfor consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while \nexercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is \nshown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the \nCourt may regard as relevant. It cannot justify an enquiry as \nto why the party was sitting idle during all the time available \nto it.  \n8.  The Supreme Court in Ramlal, Motilal and Chhotelal V Rewa \nCoalfields Ltd. also considered condonation in relation to delay \ncaused in filing an appeal by the State and observed as under:- \nMaking a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, \nthere was sufficient cause for condoning the delay in the \ninstitution of the appeal. The fact that it was the 'State' \nwhich was seeking condonation and not a private party was \naltogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law \ndemands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, \nare accorded the same treatment and the law is \nadministered in an even handed manner. There is no \nwarrant for according a step motherly treatment when the \n'State' is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In \nfact experience shows that on account of an impersonal \nmachinery (no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or \nhurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and \nthe inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the \nnote-making, file pushing, and passing-on-the-buck ethos, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:HARVINDER KAUR\nBHATIA\nSigning Date:05.07.2022\n16:59:49Signature Not Verified\n \n  \nRFA(OS) 8/2019                          Page 7 of 35  \n delay on its part is less difficult to understand though more \ndifficult to approve. In any event, the State which represents \nthe collective cause of the community does not deserve a \nlitigant-non-grata status. The Courts therefore have to be \ninformed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in \nthe course of the interpretation of the expression \"sufficient \ncause\". \n9.

The facts in brief are that the petitioner was working as senio r Foreman \nin Dwarka Depot -2. On 12.10.2011, while the petitioner was  on duty \nBus No.DL1PC 7709 came in the Depot in an accidental condition .  \nForeman of the general shift, Sh.Dinesh Singh was asked to get  the bus \nrepaired and the bus was parked in the depot for repairing.

Petitioner’s plea is that on the basis of \nfalse report  of Sh.Dinesh Thakur, charge-sheet was issued and enquiry \nwas initiated against him and the enquiry officer held him guil ty \ndespite contradiction in the statement of the witnesses.  The grievance \nof the petitioner is that acting upon the enquiry report, a show cause \nnotice was issued and the department without taking into acc ount his \nreply passed an order for stoppage of two annual increments with \ncumulative effect. The departmental appeal was dismissed.  The \npetitioner raised an industrial dispute, on which reference was made. \n3. The case of the department is that in fact, it was the petitio ner whose \nduty was to get the damaged bus repaired but neither he got th e bus \nrepaired and nor kept it in held up list and due to that reason, the bus \nhad out shedded on 12.10.2011 at 2.40 p.m..  The managemen t has \nalleged that by not getting the bus repaired and by not menti oning the \nsame in the held up buses, the petitioner had shown negligence. \n4. The labour court initially framed a preliminary issue so as to ascert ain \nwhether the enquiry was conducted in accordance with the principles of \nnatural justice. It was inter alia held that the enquiry was held  in \naccordance with principles of natural justice.  Learned counsel for th e \npetitioner has submitted that in fact, the labour court has not co nsidered \nthe material on record and therefore, the order is liable to be set aside.  \nIt has further been submitted that the respondent management has  not \nfurnished the report of Sh.Dinesh Thakur which was a material \ndocument. \n5.  Plea of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the labou r court \nhad taken into account all the documents and has passed th e order in \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003381\n \nW.P.(C) 895/2019  Page 3 of 5 accordance with law.  Perusal of the impugned award dated 26.08.20 17 \nindicates that the learned Labour court has considered all the material \non record and inter alia passed the order as under: \n “8. From the deposition of witnesses produced by \nmanagement and claimant before Enquiry Officer, it becomes \nclear that on 12.10.2011, the claimant was working as \nIncharge in night shift and his duty was from 1.00 PM t o 9.00 \nPM. At 1.45 PM, a bus No. DL-1PC-7709 had come in the \ndepot in accidental condition. The claimant had filled u p \naccident intimation report. Claimant's case is that Sh. Di nesh \nSingh Thakur, General Foreman, had obtained his signatu re \non the list of available buses and forcibly out shedd ed the \nsame saying that he would get the bus repaired in the nigh t. \nOn the other hand, management's case is that it was claimant's \nduty to get the bus repaired on the same day and if it was  not \nrepaired, he should have put the bus in the category of held  up \nbuses so that same may be got repaired at some later time but \ndeliberately, he put the buses in OK condition and he did not \nso to give benefit to the contractor i.e. whose duty was to  \nrepair the bus. \n    It has been admitted by claimant in statement of cla im \nand affidavit in evidence that the said bus had come to  the \ndepot in accidental condition. He had prepared accident \nintimation report thereof. It has further been admitted that the \nlist of available buses is bearing his signature. It was his duty \nto get the bus rectified or to put the same in held up category. \nWhy he buckled under the pressure of Sh. Dinesh Singh \nThakur? By bowing before Sh. Dinesh Singh Thakur, he did \nnot do his duty. He cannot be allowed to say that he put th e \nbus in the category of OK buses on the assurance of Sh. \nDinesh Singh Thakur that he would get the bus repaired in the \nnight. On the other hand, it is the consistent stand of S h. \nDinesh Singh Thakur, who appeared as witness No.l before  \nEnquiry Officer, that he had come to know only on 13.10. 2011 \nafter receipt of accident intimation report that the bus  No. DL-\n1PC-7709 had come to the depot in accidental condition on \n12.10.2011 and the same was neither got repaired nor put  in \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003381\n \nW.P.(C) 895/2019  Page 4 of 5 the category of held up buses.

This court in the case of Parshuram Shah v GNCTD & Anr  2008 SCC \nOnLine Del 1186 relied on a plethora of judgments of t he Supreme \nCourt including Indian Overseas Bank v. I.O.B. Staff Canteen \nWorkers (2000) 4 SCC 245 wherein the  Labour Court was held to be \nthe final court of facts. It was held that it is not appropr iate for this \nCourt, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the  \nConstitution, to re-appreciate evidence or to interfere with th e findings \nof facts as arrived at by the Labour Court.  The jurisdiction exercis ed \nby the writ court under Article 226 is supervisory and not appel late in \nnature. Reappraisal of evidence without sufficient reason in law, to \narrive at a finding of fact contrary to those arrived at by the \nSubordinate Court, is not the intent of exercising the powers  of judicial \nreview. Further in Avatar Singh Hit v. Delhi Sikh Gurudwara \nManagement Committee & Ors. , (2006) 8 SCC 487, it was held that \nmaintainability of writ when alternative remedies available are not \nexhausted. In the absence of any exceptional or extraordinary \ncircumstance for not availing proper remedy provided for in a spe cific \nact, writ petition under Art. 226 is not entertainable. \n7. Learned labour court in the further part of the award has meticul ously \nappreciated the entire evidence brought on record. The jurisdiction o f \nthe writ court while dealing with the challenge made to th e award \npassed by the Labour court is well settled.  Though the jur isdiction \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003381\n \nW.P.(C) 895/2019  Page 5 of 5 under article 226 is wide but it has to be used with circums pection.  \nThe law in its wisdom has not allowed any appeal to be filed  against \nthe award passed by the Labour court.  The Labour court is held to be \nthe final arbiter of the facts.  The writ court cannot re-apprecia te the \nevidence.  The writ court also cannot substitute its view i n place of the \nview of the Labour court merely because another view was also \npossible on the given facts and circumstances.  \n8. I consider that there is no substance in the writ petition. Hence, the writ \npetition is dismissed. \n \n \n DINESH KUMAR SHARMA, J  \nAUGUST 30, 2022 \nrb \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003381",

    "summary": "The appellant, M/s Varun Gems, owns the registered trademark ‘RAKYAN’S FINE JEWELLERY’ and sued M/s Precious Jewels for allegedly using the name ‘RAKYAN’ in a manner that was identical or deceptively similar. An interim ex‑parte injunction was initially granted but was vacated by the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.9942/2013 on the ground that the defendants were using their own name bona fide under Section 35 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The Delhi High Court Single Judge dismissed the suit, relying on the Supreme Court’s prima‑facie view that the defendants’ use was not infringing. On appeal, the High Court examined the factual background, including the family history of the Rakyan surname and the establishment of various jewellery businesses. The Court held that the critical question was whether the defendants’ use of ‘RAKYAN’ was genuine personal use or an attempt to ride on the plaintiff’s goodwill. Applying Sections 28, 29 and 35 of the Act, the Court concluded that the defendants were using the name in good faith, there was no likelihood of confusion, and the plaintiff was not entitled to any injunction or further relief. Consequently, the suit was dismissed with no costs, and a decree sheet was ordered to be drawn up.",

Various family members operate jewellery shops in Delhi under names incorporating the surname Rakyan. In 2012 an interim injunction restrained the respondents from using ‘RAKYAN’, which was later vacated by the Supreme Court. The respondents did not contest the suit, and the trial court dismissed the case, relying on the Supreme Court’s view that the defendants’ use of their own name was bona fide.",
    "arguments": "Appellant argued that the respondents’ use of ‘RAKYAN’ caused confusion and infringed its registered mark, seeking a permanent injunction. Respondents contended that ‘RAKYAN’ is their family name, used in good faith, and Section 35 protects such bona‑fide use; they relied on the Supreme Court’s interim order and the lack of similarity in shop hoardings.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the statutory provisions, especially Section 35, which saves bona‑fide use of a person’s own name. It noted that the Supreme Court’s order was only prima‑facie and not final, but the evidence showed the respondents were using the name as a family surname without intent to deceive.

The appellant has been running its business of sell ing jewellery \nunder the registered trademark ‘RAKYAN’S FINE JEWELLERY’ \nfrom the premises M-31 M-Block Market, Greater Kailash-I , New \nDelhi-110048. \n3. Mr. Jitendra Kumar Rakyan is the managing partner of the \nappellant and is the paternal uncle of respondent No. 2 (def endant No. \n2).  \n4. The facts in the present case relevant for deciding the present \nappeal are that, in the year 1951, one late Sh. Sital Dass R akyan \n(Defendant No. 2’s grandfather and father of Mr. Jitendra Ra kyan) \nstarted a jewellery business in Connaught Place, New Delhi under the \nname of M/s. SITAL DASS & SONS. Subsequently, in the year 19 61, \nMr. Sital Dass Rakyan formed a partnership firm with four  partners \nnamely, Mr. Surendra K. Rakyan, Mr. Rajendra K. Raykan, Mr. \nVirendra K. Rakyan and Mr. Jitendra K. Rakyan as partners.   \n5. In the year 1962, Mr. Surendra K. Rakyan (now deceased)  \nretired from the family business. He shifted to Jaipur, and opened \n“RAKYANS JEWELLERS” in partnership with his uncles. Whil e the \nother partners remained in Delhi and continued with the s ame \njewellery business under different names as each of them cons tituted \ndifferent firms over a period of time. \n6.

This firm  was \nalso dissolved in the year 1991. Thereafter each partner of ne wly \nconstituted SITAL DASS SONS started separate businesses u nder the \nsame name Sital Dass Jewellers and opened shops at various  places \nwithin Delhi. \n7. Mr. Jitendra K. Rakyan, in the year 2000, opened a s hop at M-\n31 M-Block Market, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi-110048 an d in the \nyear 2005, got the trademark ‘RAKYAN’S FINE JEWELLERY’ \nregistered in the name of partnership firm ‘Varun Gems’.  \n8. In the year 2011, Ravi Rakyan, son of Mr. Rajendra K Rakyan , \nopened a shop at M-32, M-Block Market, Greater Kailash-I, N ew \nDelhi-110048 under the name ‘DIAMEZ’. Subsequently, in the  year \n2012, they changed the name from ‘DIAMEZ’ to ‘NEENA & RAVI \nRAKYAN’. \n9. Initially, an interim ex-parte  injunction was granted in terms of \nthe order dated 01.06.2012, whereby the respondents were rest rained \nfrom using the name ‘RAKYAN’ or any other mark which i s identical \nor deceptively similar to the registered trademark ‘RAKY AN’S FINE \nJEWELLERY’. \n10. The respondents appealed the said decision to the Divisio n \nBench and thereafter, to the Supreme Court. The said injuncti on was \nvacated by the Hon’ble Apex Court by an order dated August  4, 2014 \npassed in SLP(C)No.9942 of 2013. The said order reads as under:  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004047\nRFA(OS)(COMM) 6/2019             Page 4 of 12“11. We have perused, the hoardings of the shops where they \nare doing the business and upon perusal of the hoardings, we do \nnot find any similarity between them. \n12. In our opinion, looking at the provisions of Section 35 of the \nAct, there is no prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff and \ntherefore, the defendants could not have been restrained from \ndoing their business. We , therefore, quash and set aside the \nimpugned order granting interim relief in favour of the plaintiff \nand the appeal is allowed with no order as to costs. \n13. We clarify that we have only expressed our prima facie \nview and the observations, if any, made in this judgment \nshall not be treated as final and the trial court shall deci de \nthe case on the basis of the, evidence which might be \nadduced before it and on the facts of the case.” \n11. The respondents did not participate in the said proceed ings and \nby an order dated 11.07.2017, proceeded ex-parte . Thereafter, ex-\nparte  evidence was led by the appellant. \n12. The appellant examined Mr. Jitendra Kumar Rakyan as its \nwitness and closed its evidence. \n13. Notwithstanding that the respondents had not contested the  suit, \nthe learned Single Judge dismissed the suit on the ground that  the \nSupreme Court had vacated the interim injunction. The learne d Single \nJudge held as under: \n“10. The reason which prevailed with the Supreme Court for \nvacating the interim injunction granted in the suit and \naffirmed by the Division Bench was, that the plaintiff was not \nentitled to injunction in view of Section 35 of the Trade \nMarks Act which permits anyone to do business in his own \nname in a bona fide manner and that it was not in dispute \nthat the defendants were doing their business in their own \nname and the bona fides of the defendants was not in dispute; \nit was also not in dispute that both parties belong to the same \nfamily and the entire family is in the business of jewellery.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004047\nRFA(OS)(COMM) 6/2019             Page 5 of 12No similarity was also found in the hoardings of the shops \nfrom where the plaintiff and the defendants were doing their \nbusinesses.  \n11. I have perused the ex parte evidence and do not find \nthe same to be dislodging the reasons which prevailed with \nthe Supreme Court for vacating the interim injunction \ngranted by this Court.  \n12. Though the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment \nobserved, as is ordinarily the rule in relation to judgments \npertaining to interim orders, that ‘nothing contained therein \nshall have a bearing on the final adjudication of the lis’ but \nin the facts of the present case, the principles laid down by \nthe Supreme Court in the judgment against the interim order \nwould continue to apply at the final stage as well and in view \nwhereof, the plaintiff is not found entitled to any injunction. \nResultantly, the question of the plaintiff being entitled to any \nother relief also does not arise.  \nDismissed.  \nNo costs.  \nDecree sheet be drawn up.” \n14. It is contended that the order of dismissal of the sui t is ex-facie \nerroneous and is based on the prima facie  view as expressed by the \nHon’ble Apex Court in its order dated August 4, 2014. \n15. It is further contended that the judgment passed by th e Hon’ble \nSupreme Court was in relation to disposal of application un der Order \nXXXIX Rule 1 & 2. The Supreme Court had reasoned that, prima \nfacie , the defendant cannot be injuncted from using their own name in \nview of Section 35 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereafter ‘the \nAct’).  \n16. It is submitted that once the evidence has been led and no t \ncontroverted by way of cross-examination, the same ha s to be \naccepted, which is sufficient to dislodge the prima facie view that the \nplaintiff is not entitled for injunction. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004047\nRFA(OS)(COMM) 6/2019             Page 6 of 12Findings \n17. We are unable to agree with the view taken by the learned \nSingle Judge. \n18. It is settled law that name and surnames are register able and are \nliable to be protected under the Act. The definition of t he marks \ncontained in Section 2(m) of the Act, specifically includes “name”, if \na trademark is used in relation to goods and services f or the purpose of \nindicating a connection in the course of trade with the said person \nhaving the right as a proprietor to use the mark. \n19. Section 28 of the Act gives exclusive right to the proprieto r of a \ntrademark to use the mark in relation to goods and servic es in respect \nof which the same is registered.   \n20. Section 29 of the Act provides that a registered mark i s \ninfringed by a person, who not being a registered proprietor  or \nassignee, uses a mark which is identical and deceptively s imilar in \nrelation to the said goods and services and also if the use of the said \nmark is likely to cause confusion on the part of the publi c. \n21. Section 35 of the Act, however, provides that a person who g ets \nthe mark registered cannot interfere with or restrain the use o f the \nmark by a person who is bona fide using the identical or nearly \nresembling mark which is his own name. \n22. Section 35 of the Act reads as under: \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004047\nRFA(OS)(COMM) 6/2019             Page 7 of 12“Section 35.  Saving for use of name, address or \ndescription of goods or services. \nNothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or \na registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere \nwith any bona fide use by a person of his own name or \nthat of his place of business, or of the name, or of the \nname of the place of business, of any of his \npredecessors in business, or the use by any person of \nany bona fide description of the character or quality of \nhis goods or services.”  \n(Emphasis supplied) \n23. Section 35 of the Act entitles a person to use his own name  \neven if that name is the registered trademark of some o ther person.  \nHowever, the pre-condition is that the said person must be using his \nname bona fide and is not to deceive the public or to create a doubt or \nconfusion in the mind of public. Section 35 of the Act does not  permit \npassing of. \n24. The Hon’ble Apex Court had vacated the interim injunctio n as \nthe Court was of the prima facie view that the defendant cannot be \ninjuncted from use of its own name in view of Section 35 of the Act. It \nis apparent that the Hon’ble Apex Court’s prima facie conclusion is \npremised on the basis that the defendant’s use of thei r name is bona \nfide. The said finding, however, is only prima facie and the Hon’ble \nSupreme Court had itself clarified that the views expresse d are only \nprima facie and the observations made shall not be treated as final. \nThe learned single Judge was required to decide the case on the basis \nof the evidence which might be adduced before it.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004047\nRFA(OS)(COMM) 6/2019             Page 8 of 1225. Therefore, the issue to be decided in this case is whe ther the use \nof its own name by defendant is bona fide  or is for the purpose of \nriding on popularity of an established trademark. \n26. The bona fide use in terms of Section 35 of the Act would mean \nan honest use by a person of his own name without any intenti on to \ndeceive and without any intention to ride on the popularity or \ngoodwill of a registered mark. \n27. It is common knowledge that the surname ‘RAKYAN’ is not a \ncommonly adopted/ used surname.  The Courts have injuncted even \ncommon surnames for the reason of them being identical or \ndeceptively similar to the registered marks on the ground of l ikelihood \nof confusion and deception. \n28.

    "summary": "The petition filed by Vikas Mittal sought restoration of bail after it was cancelled by the Sessions Court on 26 November 2020. Mittal had earlier obtained interim bail on medical grounds on 1 August 2018, which was later dismissed for non‑surrender, leading to non‑bailable warrants. He was arrested on 27 July 2020 and granted bail on 6 August 2020 with conditions of passport deposit and travel restriction. The State, dissatisfied, invoked Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. to cancel the bail, citing Mittal's prior failure to surrender. The High Court examined the material considered by the trial court, noting that the bail was granted after the investigation was complete, co‑accused had also been released, and no evidence of tampering or witness intimidation existed. Citing precedents such as Kanwar Singh Meena v. State of Rajasthan and Directorate of Enforcement v. Ratul Puri, the Court held that cancellation must be based on cogent, supervening circumstances, not merely on past conduct. It found the cancellation order infirm and restored the original bail order, directing Mittal’s release under the earlier conditions. The petition was disposed, and any pending applications were also dismissed.",
    "facts": "Vikas Mittal obtained interim bail on medical grounds on 1 August 2018, which was later dismissed for failure to surrender, resulting in non‑bailable warrants on 9 October 2018. He failed to surrender, was arrested on 27 July 2020, and was granted bail on 6 August 2020 with a personal bond of Rs.50,000, passport deposit, and travel restrictions. The State filed an application under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. on 26 November 2020 to cancel this bail, alleging Mittal's prior non‑surrender as a risk of absconding.",
    "arguments": "The State argued that Mittal's past conduct—failure to surrender after interim bail expiry—demonstrated a likelihood of absconding, justifying cancellation of bail under Section 439(2). It relied on the principle that bail can be revoked if the accused misuses the concession. Mittal, through his counsel, contended that the bail was granted after the investigation was complete, co‑accused were also released, and there was no evidence of tampering, intimidation, or any supervening circumstance warranting cancellation. He emphasized that the trial court had considered all relevant material before granting bail.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that cancellation of bail must be based on cogent, supervening circumstances that render the bail no longer conducive to a fair trial. Mere past conduct, without evidence of tampering or intimidation, is insufficient. The trial court had duly considered the material, including the completion of investigation and the release of co‑accused. Citing Kanwar Singh Meena and Directorate of Enforcement v. Ratul Puri, the Court emphasized that bail should not be cancelled mechanically. Consequently, the cancellation order was deemed infirm and set aside, restoring the original bail order with its conditions.",

JUSTICE YOGESH KHANNA \n \nYOGESH KHANNA , J.  \n1. This order may be read in continuation of my earlier order dated \n18.03.2021.  The petitioner was granted interim bail vide ord er dated \n01.08.2018 by the learned ASJ for the period of two months o n medical \ngrounds but he filed an application for extension, which appli cation was \ndismissed by the learned ASJ on 01.10.2018.  The petitioner did not \nsurrender. The NBWs were thus issued against him on 09.10.2018 a s he \nfailed to surrender on dismissal of the application for extens ion of the \ninterim bail and he approached this Court and it dispose d of the \napplication on 22.10.2018 asking him to surrender.  However, he failed \nto surrender and a notice was issued to his surety, who rather  deposited \nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRADEEP SHARMA\nSigning Date:13.04.2021 13:58Signature Not Verified\n \n                  Crl. M.C.No.12/2021                                                                   Page  2 of 5 \n the surety amount on 18.03.2019.  Thereafter the process under Section \n82/83  Cr.P.C. was issued.  The petitioner was then arrested on \n27.07.2020 and bail was granted to him on 06.08.2020.  \n2. A bare perusal of the order dated 06.08.2020 reveals the learned \nAPP for the State had opposed his bail application stating inter alia there \nare chances the applicant may again jump bail , if granted, likewise his \npast conduct .  \n3. Hence, his past conduct, though not, specifically, discussed in the \norder dated 06.08.2020, certainly  was argued on behalf of the State but \nconsidering the fact the co-accused person were already granted bail by \nthe Courts below, and one of the co-accused viz. Vinit Mittal was granted \nanticipatory bail and as the applicant was no more required for  \ninvestigation purposes, he was ordered to be released on bail on his \nfurnishing personal bond/surety of Rs.50,000/- and was directed a) to \ndeposit his passport with the court and b) not to leave the country without \nthe prior permission of the Court.  \n4. The respondent No.2 being not satisfied with the order on bail, \nmoved an application under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. for cancellation of \nthe said bail granted vide order dated 06.08.2020.  \n5. I have perused the application for cancellation of the bail which \nprimarily speaks of the past conduct of the accused viz. having  failed to \nsurrender despite his interim bail being cancelled;  his suret y amount \nbeing deposited; and process under section 82/83  Cr.P.C. having being \nissued.   \n6. Admittedly, the bail order dated 06.08.2020 was reversed and th e \nbail was cancelled vide impugned order dated 26.11.2020 primarily  on \nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRADEEP SHARMA\nSigning Date:13.04.2021 13:58Signature Not Verified\n \n                  Crl. M.C.No.12/2021                                                                   Page  3 of 5 \n his past conduct viz. failure to surrender after expiry of his interim bail.  \nThe relevant portion of the impugned order is:  \n“Ld. ASJ (N/W) while dismissing the bail application vide \norder dated 1/10/2018 had gone to the facts of the case in detail and \nobserved that such kind of heinous offences amounts to misuse of the \njudicial process and has to be dealt with seriousness lest it erodes \nthe faith of the public in the entire judicial system. The accused Vikas \nMittal/Non-applicant has not only fled away after seeking interim \nbail on medical grounds but also failed to fulfill his undertaking \nbefore Hon’ble High Court of Delhi for surrendering before the ld. \nTrial Court. Such kind of conduct of the accused/non-applicant Vikas \nMittal should have been taken into account by Ld.C.M.M. (N/W) \nwhile disposing the bail application. \nThough there is no such subsequent conduct of tampering with \nthe evidence or threatening the witnesses etc. as contended by ld. \nCounsel for the non-applicant/accused but keeping in view his \nprevious conduct there is likelihood that he may not make himself \navailable for trial. In criminal Jurisprudence, accused have been \ngiven many rights but at the same time rights of the complainant \ncannot be overlooked altogether who may ultimately loose faith in \nthe judicial system.”  \n7. Though the learned ASJ noted there is no subsequent conduct of \ntampering with the evidence or threatening the witnesses  yet keeping in \nview his  previous  conduct that he may not make himself available, \ncancelled his bail by impugned order.  \n8. The learned APP for the State has referred to Kanwar Singh Meena \nv. State of Rajasthan , (2012) 12 SCC 180 wherein it was held if the Court \ngranting bail ignores  the relevant material indicating prima facie \ninvolvement of the accused or takes into account irrelevant material \nwhich has no relevance to the grant of bail to the accused, th e Sessions \nCourt or the High Court would be justified in cancelling the bail.   \n9. The learned APP argues the impugned order was justified and \nhence the petition against it be dismissed.   \nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRADEEP SHARMA\nSigning Date:13.04.2021 13:58Signature Not Verified\n \n                  Crl. M.C.No.12/2021                                                                   Page  4 of 5 \n 10. No doubt bail can be cancelled in case where the order granting \nbail suffers from infirmities resulting in miscarriage of justi ce or if it is \ngranted by the court ignoring the relevant material or where it is  granted \non material which has no relevance to the issue of grant of bail  but a bare \nperusal of the order dated 06.08.2020 would reveal the entire m aterial \nwas perused by the learned MM before the grant of bail. The order of the \nlearned MM granting bail to the appellant cannot be termed as perverse  \nas learned MM was conscious of the fact the investigation was complete  \nand the custody of the petitioner was not required .  The learned CMM \nwas also aware of the previous  conduct of the petitioner of not \nsurrendering in time and also that co-accused person were gran ted bail \nand one of them got anticipatory bail.  Thus, it cannot be said  relevant \nmaterial for grant of bail was never considered. Rather the impugne d \norder shows despite there being no subsequent conduct of tam pering with \nthe record or threatening of the witnesses yet keeping his previous \nconduct in mind viz. there is likelihood he may not be available for trial, \nhis bail was cancelled. The impugned order admittedly was passe d on an \napprehension of the learned Sessions Court but it was no cogent  ground \nto cancel the bail, hence, the impugned order suffers from infirmity and is \naccordingly set aside.  \n11. In Directorate of Enforcement vs. Ratul Puri  2020 SCC Online Del \n97 it was held: \n“28. In case of Dolat Ram and others vs. State of \nHaryana: (1995) 1 SCC 349, it is observed by the Hon’ble \nSupreme Co urt that “very cogent and overwhelming \ncircumstances are necessary for an order directing the \ncancellation of the bail, already granted. Generally speaking \nthe grounds of cancellation of bail, broadly are interference or \nattempt to interfere with the due course of administration of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRADEEP SHARMA\nSigning Date:13.04.2021 13:58Signature Not Verified\n \n                  Crl. M.C.No.12/2021                                                                   Page  5 of 5 \n justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course of justice \nor abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any \nmanner. The satisfaction of the Court, on the basis of material \nplaced on the record of the possibility of accused absconding is \nyet another reason justifying the cancellation of bail. However, \nbail once granted should not be cancelled in a mechanical \nmanner without considering whether any supervening \ncircumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to a fair \ntrial to allow the accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the \nconcession of bail during the trial.”  \n32. It is settled that once bail granted should not be \ncancelled in a mechanical manner without considering any \nsupervening circumstances which is not conducive to fair trial. \nIt cannot be cancelled on a request from the side of the \ncomplainant/investigating agency unless and until it is \nestablished that the same is being misused and it is no longer \nconducive in the interest of justice to allow the accused any \nfurther to remain on bail. No doubt, the bail can be cancelled \nonly in those discerning few cases where is established that a \nperson to whom the concession of bail has been granted is \nmisusing the same. However, all those facts are missing in the \npresent case.”   \n12.  Even otherwise, the petitioner is in Judicial custody since \n27.10.2019. Thus the order dated 26.11.2020 is set aside. I restore the \norder dated 06.08.2020 and admit him to bail with the cond ition(s) \nimposed per order dated 06.08.2020 of the learned MM.  \n13. Petition stands disposed of. Pending application(s), if any, a lso \nstands disposed of.  \n \n       YOGESH KHANNA, J.  \nAPRIL 12, 2021 \nVLD \nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRADEEP SHARMA\nSigning Date:13.04.2021 13:58Signature Not Verified",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court heard four public‑interest writ petitions filed by various petitioners seeking relief for prisoners amid the COVID‑19 pandemic. The petitions demanded: (i) detailed affidavits on COVID‑19 cases in Delhi jails; (ii) guidelines for interim bail or special parole; (iii) assurance of RT‑PCR testing facilities; (iv) prompt communication of test results; (v) release of under‑trials and convicts, especially those with medical ailments; and (vi) direction to provide non‑COVID medical facilities for inmates. The Court, after noting that the substantive reliefs in three of the petitions were largely addressed by the High Powered Review Committee (HPC) decisions of 4 May and 11 May 2021 and a Supreme Court ruling of 7 May 2021, held that most prayers did not survive. However, it issued specific directions: the State must ensure medical investigations/treatments are conducted in non‑COVID hospitals when referral hospitals are fully dedicated to COVID care; it must continue testing prisoners via RAT and RT‑PCR; and it must consider release of under‑trials under Section 436A where appropriate. The Court dismissed the broader release orders but partially allowed the petitions by mandating procedural safeguards and medical care provisions. The judgment balances public health concerns with prisoners’ rights, emphasizing that the State cannot deny essential medical services even during a pandemic.",
    "facts": "Four writ petitions were filed in the Delhi High Court in 2021 by RK Gossaín, Kanhaiya Singhal & Anr., Shobha Gupta, and the India Under‑Trial Prisoner Support Forum. All petitions arose from the COVID‑19 outbreak in Delhi’s jails and sought court‑ordered reliefs such as detailed affidavits on infection rates, guidelines for interim bail or parole, mandatory RT‑PCR testing for inmates, rapid communication of test results, and the release of under‑trial and convicted prisoners, especially those with medical conditions. The petitioners alleged inadequate testing, lack of non‑COVID medical facilities, and neglect of non‑COVID patients. The State (GNCTD) opposed the broad release orders, citing the High Powered Review Committee (HPC) recommendations and Supreme Court guidance on prison de‑congestion during the pandemic.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the pandemic created a health emergency in overcrowded jails, justifying the release of prisoners under Section 436A CrPC and the provision of non‑COVID medical facilities. They sought mandatory testing, timely result dissemination, and interim bail/parole to prevent loss of life. The State contended that the HPC’s recommendations and Supreme Court’s May 2021 decision already addressed de‑congestion, and that non‑COVID patients were being treated in jail hospitals or referred hospitals. The State also highlighted that many reliefs were already implemented, such as RAT and RT‑PCR testing, and that releasing prisoners indiscriminately could compromise public safety.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the substantive reliefs sought in three petitions were largely covered by the HPC decisions of 4 May and 11 May 2021 and the Supreme Court’s 7 May 2021 order. Consequently, most prayers did not survive. However, the Court recognized that the State must not deny essential medical investigations or treatment to inmates because a referral hospital is a COVID‑only facility. It directed the State to arrange non‑COVID hospitals for such purposes and to continue comprehensive testing of prisoners. The Court also affirmed that Section 436A can be invoked for eligible under‑trials, but any release must be in line with the HPC recommendations and not undermine public safety.

We have highlighted the substantive reliefs sought in these four \npetitions, and those not highlighted are primarily to achieve the highlighted \nreliefs. \n3. We find that practically none of the substantive prayers survive in the \nfirst three petitions i.e. W.P.(C) No. 4936/2021, 5153/2021 & 5033/2021.  \nTo the extent they survive, they are being dealt with by us. The prisoners are \nbeing tested for Covid-19 through Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) as well as the \nRT-PCR Test.  So far as the reliefs sought for release of the prisoners – both \nUTPs and convicts are concerned, they substantially stand addressed in the \nlight of the decisions of the High Powered Review Committee (HPC), taken \nin its meetings held on 04.05.2021 and 11.05.2021 in the light of the \ndecision rendered by the Supreme Court on 07.05.2021.There is no \nchallenge to the recommendation of the HPC in these petitions.  \n4. The grievance raised by Mr. Singhal that the non-Covid patients are \nbeing neglected, does not appear to be correct, since there are Jail Hospitals \nin every Jail which are treating such patients, and wherever necessary, they \nare being taken to larger referal hospitals for treatment of non-Covid-19 \nailments.   \n5. Mr. Singhal has drawn our attention to one instance where in Case \nFIR No.811/2016, PS-New Usmanpur, Delhi, the learned Trial Court was \ninformed by the State in its status report, that Pulmonary Function Test \nDigitally Signed\nBy:BHUPINDER SINGH\nROHELLA\nSigning Date:25.05.2021 16:37Signature Not Verified\n \n \nW.P.(C.) No.4936/2021 & connected matters. Page 7 o f 12 (PFT), which was required to be conducted on the accused, could not be \nconducted since that test was not available in the CJ-10 Dispensary, and Dr.  \nBaba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, along with Lok Nayak Hospital and Deen \nDayal Upadhyay Hospital have all been converted into 100% Covid Facility.  \nTherefore, the PFT on the accused could not be done at present.  He submits \nthat in all such cases, the State should take the responsibility of getting the \nrequisite test conducted in some other hospital, which may not be a fully \nCovid-19 dedicated facility.  The report submitted by the Medical Officer \nin-charge in the said case further went on to state that “ At present  the \nmedical condition of the inmate is stable and satisfactory ” and that \nprescribed medications are being provided to him by the Jail Dispensary.  \nOn our query, Mr. Singhal states that the said inmate was granted interim \nbail by the Trial Court.  Mr. Singhal submits that in every case, it may not be \npossible for the Jail inmate to approach the Court, and in all such cases, \nwhere the referral hospital is a 100% Covid facility, the Jail Authorities \nshould get the relevant test/ investigation and treatment conducted at another \nhospital, which may not be 100% Covid facility.   \n6. We may observe that whenever such a position is placed before the \nCourt dealing with bail applications, invariably, the Courts pass directions \nfor medical examination/ treatment of the accused by a non-Covid facility, \nin case the referral hospital is a 100% Covid facility.  It can never be that the \naccused is left unattended, and denied the investig ation/ treatment that he/ \nshe may require.  We agree with the submission of Mr. Singhal that the \naccused cannot be told that the referral hospital i s a 100% Covid facility \nand, hence, his treatment/ investigation cannot be undertaken.  To that \nDigitally Signed\nBy:BHUPINDER SINGH\nROHELLA\nSigning Date:25.05.2021 16:37Signature Not Verified\n \n \nW.P.(C.) No.4936/2021 & connected matters. Page 8 o f 12 extent, we direct the State to ensure that whatever  investigation/ treatment  \nis required by the accused, should be provided to him/ her by approaching \nanother hospital which may offer the investigation/  treatment and which is \nnot a 100% Covid facility, in case the referral hospital is a 100% Covid \nfacility. \n7. Mr. Mathur, learned senior counsel who appears in W.P.(Crl.) \nNo.7/2021 has raised a grievance with regard to non-consideration of the \ncases entitled to be considered for release under Section 436A of the Cr.P.C.  \nMr. Mathur submits that the Under-Trial Review Committee (UTRC) which \nhas been constituted for consideration of cases falling under Section 436A",

    "summary": "The appeal filed by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax challenged the ITAT's order dismissing the revenue's appeal and upholding the CIT(A) order that deleted an addition of Rs.10,57,01,194 made by the Assessing Officer under section 2(22)(e) of the Income Tax Act. The appellant argued that the transaction was a sham, the agreement was unregistered and on a Rs.100 stamp paper, and thus fell within the anti‑avoidance provisions of section 2(22)(e). The respondents contended that the advance received was a genuine commercial advance for the booking of a commercial space, not a loan, and that the CIT(A) and Tribunal findings on facts were correct. The Court examined the factual findings of the CIT(A) and Tribunal, noting that the advance was received against the sale of commercial space, that the company owed money to the assessee, and that the transaction was in the ordinary course of business. Citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Vikram Krishna Vs PCIT and the principle from Hero Vinoth (Minor) vs Seshammal, the Court held that the Tribunal’s factual findings were not perverse and that the addition under section 2(22)(e) was correctly deleted. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed.",
    "facts": "The Assessing Officer added Rs.10,57,01,194 to the assessee's income under section 2(22)(e), treating an advance received from Apra Auto (India) P Ltd as a loan. The CIT(A) and the ITAT held that the advance was a commercial advance for the booking of a commercial space being built by the assessee, and therefore fell outside section 2(22)(e). The appellant argued the agreement was unregistered and on a Rs.100 stamp paper, alleging a scheme to avoid tax. The respondent maintained that the transaction was genuine, that the company owed money to the assessee, and that the advance was in the nature of business advance.",
    "arguments": "Appellant: The addition was justified under section 2(22)(e) because the agreement was informal, unregistered, and on a low‑value stamp paper, indicating a scheme to convert a loan into a sale. The Supreme Court’s decision in Vikram Krishna Vs PCIT was cited to support this view. Respondent: The advance was received against the sale of commercial space, was recorded by the AO, and the CIT(A) and Tribunal findings that the transaction was in the ordinary course of business were correct. The transaction fell within the exception clause of section 2(22)(e).",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the factual findings of the CIT(A) and the Tribunal were consistent and not perverse. The advance was a genuine commercial advance, not a loan, and therefore section 2(22)(e) was inapplicable. The Supreme Court’s dismissal of a Special Leave Petition in Vikram Krishna does not constitute endorsement of the lower court’s view, and the facts of the present case differed materially. The Court also relied on the principle that where two factual inferences are possible, the lower appellate court’s inference should not be disturbed. Hence, the Tribunal’s order deleting the addition was upheld and the appeal dismissed.",

PCIT \n(2020) 114 taxmann.com 197 (SC )? \nii. Whether in law and on facts of the case the ord er of the \nHon'ble  ITAT is not erroneous and not perverse? ” \n2. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the appellant \nsubmits that the finding of the Commissioner, Incom e Tax Appeal \n[‘CIT(A)’] and Tribunal are incorrect and bad in law and the findi ng \nof the Assessing Officer must be accepted, inasmuch  as, the agreement \nbetween the parties was not registered and was made  only on a stamp \npaper of Rs. 100/ -. \n3. Having heard learned counsel for the appella nt, this Court finds \nthat the issue canvassed during the hearing is not one of the proposed \nquestions of law. In fact, the proposed question of law is that whether \nthe Tribunal erred in deleting the addition of Rs. 1 0,57,01,194/ - made \nby the Assessing Officer under Section 2(22)(e) of the Income Tax \nAct, 1961 (‘the Act’) in contravention of the law l aid down by the \nSupreme Court in the case of Vikram Krishna Vs. PCIT (2020), 114 \ntaxmann.com 197 (SC) .  \n4. A perusal of the paper  book reveals that the Supreme Cou rt \ndismi ssed the Special Leave Petition in limine  against the judgment of \nthis Court in Vikram Krishna (supra) .  It is settled law that  summary \ndismissal of Special Leave Petition does not mean a pproval by the \nSupreme Court of the view taken by the High Co urt. Further,  the \nDivision Bench had dismissed the appeal filed by th e assessee holding \nthat in view of the peculiar facts in that case, th e agreement to sell and \ncancellation of such agreement was merely a cover u p with the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KRISHNA BHOJ\nSigning Date:29.09.2021\n23:51:10Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 1/2021                            Page 3 of 6 \n camouflage for giving loan to the assessee by the c ompany to avoid \ncontravention under Section 2(22)(e) of the Act.  \n5. In the present case, both the CIT (A) as well as Tribunal have \ngiven findings of the fact that the advance receive d from the company \nby the assessee was in the nature of t rade advanced booking of \ncommercial place being built by the assessee. Both the CIT (A) as well \nas the Tribunal have further held that in the prese nt case, it was the \ncompany which owed money to the assessee rather tha n the other way \nround. The relevant findings of the CIT (A) as well as Tribunal are \nreproduced hereinbelow: - \n \n13. The perusal of AO/JCIT's comments in the remand \nreport clearly shows that no distinction between the two \ndeals has been pointed out either during assessm ent \nproceedings or the appellate proceedings. It has be en the \nclaim of the appellant  that both the deals were entered into \nduring the year under consideration in the normal c ourse Finding of the CIT(A): - \n“12. The AO had further highlighted in the assessmen t \norder at page no 9 that the appellant had taken loans and \nadvances from Apra Auto (India) P Ltd in earlier y ears as \nwell. In this regard, the appellant was directed to  file his \nledger account with Apra Auto (India) P Ltd and vic e- \nversa so as to see if the facts were as highlighted by the AO  \nin the assessment order. It is seen that for the FY  11-12 i.e. \nprecedin g FY, the appellant had a outstanding from Apra \nAuto (India) P Ltd as on 01.04.2010 to the tune of R s \n1,11,43,224 and during the entire year, various pay ments \nhave been made either by the company or by the appe llant \nbut at no point of time, there is any ne t outstanding by the \nappellant towards Apra Auto (India) P Ltd. In view o f this, \nthe observations of the AO as mentioned above does not \nseem to have factual legs . \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KRISHNA BHOJ\nSigning Date:29.09.2021\n23:51:10Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 1/2021                            Page 4 of 6 \n of business and the AO could not accept one with th e \noutside party and reject one  with the associate corporate \nentity. It is seen that the  appellant had received an amount \nof Rs.2,50,00,000 from  N.H. Learning Infrastructure \nServices Ltd in pursuance of the  agreement t o sell and the \nsaid receipt of amount has been  accepted as such by the \nAO which means that the AO was  satisfied with regard to \nthe identity, creditworthiness and  genuineness of the \ntransaction so as not to invite any deeming  provisions u/s \n68 with referenc e to the said amount. This  being so it was \nnot open to the AO to treat another exactly  similar \ntransaction entered into by the appellant with the  company \nin which he is substantially interested as not bein g in the \nordinary course of business. Nothing has b een highlighted  \nto draw any distinction between the two transaction s as the  \nlanguage as well as the judicial stamp paper used f or both \nthe transactions is exactly the same. Therefore, I don' t find \nlogic  in the conclusion of the AO in treating the impugne d \ntransaction with M/s Apra Auto India P. Ltd as bein g one \nfor the purposes of avoiding the provisions of section \n2(22)(e). Here, it would be important to note that the \nappellant had an  amount receivable to the tune of Rs \n78,84,793 and Rs1,95,390 as on 31.03 .2011 and \n31.03.2011 from M/s Apra  Auto India P. Ltd. The perusal \nof the copy of account shows  that during the entire period \nof the FY under consideration,  there have been amounts \noutstanding towards M/s Apra Auto  India P. Ltd rather \nthan the other way round. Therefore, apart  from receipt of \namounts on account of the proposed  commercial sale by \nthe appellant, no amounts had been  received by the \nappellant from M/s Apra Auto India P. Ltd. The  amounts \nthat had been received were on account of  repayments by \nM/s Apra Auto India P. Ltd to the appellant  rather than \nother way round. The transaction of proposed sale  of \ncommercial space, being on commercial consideration s \nand in the normal course of business of the appellant \nclearly comes  in the exception clause of se ction 2(22)(e). In \nview of the above facts and circumstances of the ca se, the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KRISHNA BHOJ\nSigning Date:29.09.2021\n23:51:10Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 1/2021                            Page 5 of 6 \n addition made by the AO to the tune of Rs. 10,57,01 ,194 is \ndirected to be deleted.”  \n6. Keeping in view the concur rent finding s of fact by the CIT (A) \nas well as by the Tribunal, this Court is of the vi ew that the said Finding of the Tribunal: - \n“17. In nutshell, the assessee has also not received  any \nadvance in the nature of loan or advances as contemplated \nin the section 2(22)(e) of the Income tax Act, 1961  but \nreceived advance against sale of commercial space \ndeveloped by the assessee on his own land in collab oration \nwith M/s Unitech Limited as per Buyer's agre ement. We \nfind that provisions of section 2(22)(e) of the Inc ome tax \nAct, 1961 are not applicable in case of the assesse e as the \nassessee has received advance of Rs.5,62,00,000/fro m the \nsaid company against sale of commercial space in \nSignature Tower - II, Sector - 15, Gurgaon, Haryana. \nSince, the said receipts of advance of Rs.5,62,00,0 00/- \nagainst sale of commercial space is not a receipt i n the \nnature of loan or advance as contemplated in sectio n \n2(22)(e) of the Income tax Act, 1961 which attracts  the \nprovisions of in that section as the said advance is in the \nnature of business advance which did not fall withi n the \nambit of provisions of section 2(22)(e) of the  Income Tax \nAct, 1961.  \nxxx  xxx  xxx  xxx \n19. Having gone through the entire factum of the is sue, the \ncase laws cited by both the parties, rationale of t he ld. CIT \n(A), keeping in view the fact that it is the compan y which \nowes the assessee the money rather vice -versa, it is \nunequivocally proved that the advance received from  the \ncompany by the assessee is in the nature of trade a dvance \nagainst the booking of commercial place being built  by the \nassessee, we hereby decline to interfere with the o rder of \nthe ld. CIT (A) in deleting the addition made by the  AO u/s \n2(22)(e).” \n \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KRISHNA BHOJ\nSigning Date:29.09.2021\n23:51:10Signature Not Verified\n \nITA 1/2021                            Page 6 of 6 \n finding s should not be lightly interfered with.   In fact, t he Supreme \nCourt in Hero Vinoth (Minor) vs. Seshammal, (2006) 5 SCC 545  has \nalso held that “in a case where from a given set of circumstances tw o \ninferences of fact are possible, the one drawn by t he lower appellate \ncourt will not be interfered by the High Court in s econd appeal.  \nAdopting any other approach is not permissible. ”  It has also held that \nthere is a difference between question of law and a  “substantial \nquestion of law”.  \n7. In any event the impugned judgment in no manner can  be said \nto be in contravention of the judgment of this Court in Vikram \nKrishna ( supra)  which admittedly proceeded on  the peculiar facts of \nthe said case.

    "summary": "The petitioner, Nadeem Qureshi, filed a writ petition under Article 226 seeking a mandamus directing the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) to allow reconstruction of his alleged property (No. 551, 18.40 sq m) and to award Rs 20 lakh as compensation. Qureshi relied on a GPA, will and gift deed allegedly executed by his mother, and asserted 60 years of uninterrupted possession and payment of statutory dues. NDMC contested the claim, stating that a show‑cause notice dated 09‑12‑2017 under Sections 415/417 of the DMC Act was issued for illegal meat‑sale operations, leading to a sealing order on 03‑03‑2018 and demolition on 10‑11‑2020. The corporation further argued that the structure was an encroachment on public toilet land, as confirmed by engineering and land‑estate reports measuring the area at 122.64 sq m. The Court held that the dispute centered on factual questions of title and measurement, which are not amenable to writ jurisdiction. It directed the petitioner to approach the appropriate civil court for determination of ownership and damages. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed without prejudice to the parties' rights.",
    "facts": "Petitioner claims ownership of property No. 551 (18.40 sq m) behind Delite Cinema, based on a GPA, will and gift deed, and 60 years of possession, paying taxes and utilities. Respondent NDMC issued a show‑cause notice under Sections 415/417 of the DMC Act for unlicensed meat‑sale, sealed the premises, and demolished it. Engineering and land‑estate reports indicated the structure encroached on public toilet land measuring 122.64 sq m. The property has been demolished.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that long‑standing possession, payment of dues and documentary title establish ownership and entitlement to reconstruction and compensation. Respondent argued that the structure was an illegal encroachment, that the show‑cause notice and sealing were lawful, and that the matter involves factual disputes over title and measurement, which are beyond the scope of a writ petition.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the core issues—title to the land and exact dimensions—are factual disputes requiring evidence and adjudication by a civil court. Writ jurisdiction under Article 226 is limited to questions of law and jurisdiction, not to determine ownership. Hence, the petition cannot be entertained, and the petitioner must seek relief in the appropriate forum. The dismissal is without prejudice to any future civil proceedings.",

Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that th e petitioner is \nthe owner/occupant of property bearing  No. 551 (GF-18.40 sq. mtrs.), \nChatta Lal Miya, behind Delite Cinema, Delhi  (hereinafter, referred to as the \n‘subject property ’). In this regard, reliance is placed on documents, \nincluding GPA, Will, and Gift Deed placed on record, stated to be executed \nby the mother of the present petitioner in his favor. In support of t he claim of \nownership, it is also averred that the petitioner has been in  occupation of the \nsubject property for the last 60 years and has regularly paid electricity \ncharges, water charges, property tax, etc. relating to the subject property, as \nwell as conversion, parking and registration charges for conv ersion of its use \nfrom residential to commercial. It is further averred that the \nrespondent/Corporation had issued various challans from time to  time, \nwhich were also paid by the petitioner and receipts of the s ame have been \nplaced on record. Lastly, it is contended that having been in continuous \nphysical possession of the subject property for the last 60 years, the \npetitioner is the owner/occupant thereof.  \n3. Mr. Mukesh Gupta, learned Standing Counsel for the \nrespondent/North DMC, on the other hand, while disputing the submissions \nof the learned counsel for the petitioner, has submitted that i nitially a Show \nCause Notice dated 09.12.2017 under Sections 415/417 of the D MC Act, \n1957 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’ ) was issued to the petitioner for \nrunning a trade of sale of O ffal’s meat from the subject property without a \nvalid Municipal trade license as well as in unhygienic an d insanitary \ncondition. The same was statedly followed by a sealing order da ted \n03.03.2018 issued under Sections 417/415 of the Act. Subs equently, the \nsubject property came to be demolished on 10.11.2020.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:09.05.2022\n19:12:37Signature Not Verified\nW.P.(C) 4/2021     Page 3 of 5  It is further submitted that without prejudice to the above, at  the time \nof consideration of the request for de-sealing made by the petiti oner, file \nrelated to the subject property was initially sent to the E ngineering \nDepartment to examine status of the property. At the time,  it was found that \nthe same was constructed by encroaching upon the land of to ilet block. \nThereafter, the Land & Estate Department informed that the subject property \nwas registered in the immovable property Register at C No. 60, pag e No. 09 \nwith the details that there is Dhalao, Toilet, Urinal opposite Delite Cinema, \nRakab Ganj, Delhi. As per the information provided by the Land & Estate \nDepartment, the land is measuring 292.2 sq. meters. \n4. Learned Standing Counsel has further submitted that an i nspection of \nthe toilet block was carried out by the team of the respondent/Corpo ration \non 08.06.2018 and the area was found to measure 122.64 sq. meters. In this \nregard, he has drawn attention of the Court to the Status Report place d on \nrecord, where it is stated as follows :- \n“ix) That the measurement of the toilet blocks, urinal block and \nits area including details of measurement for shop N o. 551 and \nplan carried out by the engineering department JE(W)I, EE-\nM/II/CSPZ and it is further submitted the total number o f seats \nin the toilet block is 48 Numbers including 2 Washrooms  and 2 \nUrinal block found during the inspection.  That as per the \nmeasurement, details of the area has been calculated as 122 .64 \nsq. metrs. with the observation that there is no evidence of meat \nshops and it is existing on the Government land.  This \nland/property pertains to DEMS (Department of Environme ntal \nMainteancne Services) therefore DEMS was to fix the program \nfor removal of the encroachments and Works Department wi ll \nassist the DEMS during the encroachment removal progra m \nwhich was approved by the competent authority i.e. Dy. \nCommissioner/City-S.P. Zone.  The programme for demolition \nwas fixed by booking local police force on dated 15.10.2018, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:09.05.2022\n19:12:37Signature Not Verified\nW.P.(C) 4/2021     Page 4 of 5  12.12.2018 and 18.12.2018 with the Dy.

Thus , the case of the respondent/Corporation is that the petitioner has \nencroached upon public land, without the subject property ever being \nallotted to him. \n6. In addition to the foregoing, learned Standing Counsel has contended \nthat the present case involves disputed questions of fact w hich cannot be \ngone into while deciding a writ petition. In this regard, he has placed \nreliance on the order dated 12.11.2010 passed by a Co-ordinate Benc h of \nthis Court in Joginder Kaur v. M.C.D. & Ors. (and other connected petitions) \nreported as 2010 SCC OnLine Del 3941 , as well as the order dated \n24.12.2010 passed by a Division Bench in LPA No.915/2010  arising out of \nthe said decision. It is pointed out that the aforesaid decisi ons were also \nfollowed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in R.S. Juneja & O rs. v. \nMCD reported as 2015 SCC OnLine Del 10701 . \n7. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused  the \nmaterial placed on record.  \n8. In the present case, the petitioner has claimed ownership of th e \nsubject property admeasuring 18.40 sq. m. on the basis of variou s \ndocuments as well as continued physical possession for the l ast 60 years. He \nhas also claimed to have made various payments towards statuto ry dues \nrelating to the subject property.  \n9. On the other hand, the respondent/Corporation has disputed t he claims \nof the petitioner and stated that the subject property was  built by \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:09.05.2022\n19:12:37Signature Not Verified\nW.P.(C) 4/2021     Page 5 of 5  encroaching upon the land of toilet block. \n10. Admittedly, the subject property already stands demolishe d. The \nquestions raised on behalf of the petitioner are disputed qu estions of fact \nwith respect not only to the title of the property, but also  to the \nmeasurements of the same. These questions, in the opinion of this Court, \ncannot be determined under writ jurisdiction.  \n11. In this backdrop, this Court finds force in the submissio ns of learned \nStanding Counsel for the respondent/Corporation that the p etitioner ought to \napproach the appropriate Court for establishing his legal title/p ossession \nover the subject property, as well as for relief of damages as claimed herein. \n12. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. \n13. It is clarified that this order has been passed without p rejudice to the \nrights and contentions of the respective parties and the same sha ll remain \nreserved.   \n  \n \nMANOJ KUMAR OHRI \n           JUDGE \nAPRIL 12, 2022 \nga/na \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SANGEETA ANAND\nSigning Date:09.05.2022\n19:12:37Signature Not Verified",

    "summary": "The appeal filed by M/s Graphisads Private Limited challenges a judgment of a Single Judge dated 01‑06‑2018 that upheld a blacklisting order dated 12‑06‑2015 against the company by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The blacklisting order had no expiry date, which the appellant argued contravenes Supreme Court precedent in Kulja Industries Ltd. v. Chief General Manager (2014) 14 SCC 731. Both parties agreed to settle the outstanding dues arising from two contracts – the Parking Media Contract and the Street Furniture Cluster No.2 Contract – but disputed the quantum of interest and surcharge. The respondent claimed principal, interest (calculated at 24%), and advertisement tax, while the appellant offered to pay the principal and tax and to accept interest at 8% per annum. The Court, noting the prolonged dispute and the impact of COVID‑19, held that interest should be fixed at a reasonable 8% simple rate for both contracts, ordered payment of the principal amounts and advertisement tax as calculated by SDMC, and left the question of surcharge (potentially a penalty) to be resolved, possibly via arbitration. The judgment thus partially allows the appellant’s relief by fixing a lower interest rate while leaving other issues open for further determination.",
    "facts": "The appellant, Graphisads Private Limited, was blacklisted by SDMC on 12‑06‑2015 without a specified end date. The blacklisting stemmed from alleged non‑payment of dues under two contracts: the Parking Media Contract (2009‑2014) and the Street Furniture Cluster No.2 Contract (2010‑2017). The respondent claimed large sums comprising principal, interest, surcharge and advertisement tax. The appellant contended the blacklisting order was invalid for lacking an expiry date and offered to settle the principal and tax while seeking a reduced interest rate of 8% instead of the respondent’s 24% calculation.",
    "arguments": "The appellant argued that the blacklisting order violated Supreme Court precedent requiring a definite period, and that the 24% interest rate was excessive given prevailing market rates and the COVID‑19 pandemic. The respondent maintained that the contract terms entitled it to the claimed amounts, including interest at 24% and surcharge, and that the blacklisting was lawful. Both parties expressed willingness to resolve the outstanding dues and suggested arbitration for any remaining disputes.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court accepted that the blacklisting order without an end date conflicted with the Supreme Court’s decision in Kulja Industries Ltd., but refrained from setting aside the order, opting instead to address the monetary dispute. Considering the prolonged litigation, the impact of COVID‑19, and prevailing lower interest rates on deposits and loans, the Court deemed an 8% simple interest rate equitable for both contracts. It ordered payment of the principal amounts and advertisement tax as calculated by SDMC and left the surcharge issue, potentially a penalty, to be determined, possibly through arbitration.",

Notice in this appeal was issued by a coordinate Bench of this Court \non 13.08.2019, while delay in filing the appeal was condon ed by the very \nsame Bench on 06.11.2019. \n3. Although opportunity was given to file a reply to th e appeal, no reply \nhas been filed on behalf of the respondent/South Delhi Munici pal \nCorporation ( “SDMC ”).   \n4.

According to us, this is contrary to the decision rendered by the \nSupreme Court in Kulja Industries Ltd . v. Chief General Manager, \nWestern Telecom Project Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and Ors., (2014 ) 14 \nSCC 731 .    \n7. That being said, both Mr Poddar as well as Mr Nitin Mit tal, who \nappears on behalf of the appellant/Company submit, that they  are willing to \nmove forward, and have the issue concerning outstanding due s payable by \nthe appellant/Company resolved.   \n7.1 This position has been taken by the counsel for the pa rties, as, even if, \nwe were to set aside the blacklisting order, on the ground th at it does not \nhave an end date, we would have to remand the matter to the \nrespondent/SDMC for a de novo  exercise.    \n7.2 This, according to both Mr Poddar and Mr Mittal, will keep the \ndispute alive.   \n8. Therefore, it is in this light, that the respondent/SDMC has made the \nfollowing offer, with regard to the dues payable by the appellant /Company \nconcerning two contracts which are in issue i.e., Parking Media Contract and \nStreet Furniture Cluster No.2 Contract. \n8.1 According to the respondent/SDMC, the amounts due vis-à-vis the \nParking Media Contract are as mentioned in the following table:  \n \nTable-A:  \nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\nKUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:27.10.2022\n17:32:25Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004463 \n \nLPA No.99/2019                                                                                                                         Page 3 of 9 \n PARKING MEDIA \nM/s Graphisads (P) Limited DUES ABSTRACT UP TO AUGUST 2022 \n Period of Contract   \nS\n.\nN\no\n.

It would be evident, that insofar as the details given i n Table-A above \nare concerned, the respondent/SDMC has sought not only the pay ment of \nthe principal amount, but also amounts towards interest and a dvertisement \ntax.   \n11. Mr Mittal, on instructions of Mr Mukesh Gupta, Director of t he \nappellant/Company, says that the appellant/Company would pay  the \nprincipal amount, which is pegged at Rs. 54,18,660 /-, as also the \nadvertisement tax, which is crystallized as Rs. 13,296 /-.   \n \nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\nKUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:27.10.2022\n17:32:25Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004463 \n \nLPA No.99/2019                                                                                                                         Page 7 of 9 \n 11.1 Insofar as interest is concerned, Mr Mittal, once again on i nstructions, \nsays that the appellant/Company is willing to pay interest  at the rate of 8% \n(simple), instead of 24%, as calculated by the respondent/SDMC. \n12. We are of the view, that given the fact that the dispute has re mained \nunresolved for quite some time, and the appellant/Company has  been \nimpacted, as contended by them, on account of COVID-19, it seems both  \nfair and just, that interest is charged at a reasonable rate, having regard to the \nfact that interest rates on deposits have fallen considerably.   \n12.1 Furthermore, as things stand today, interest rates on loans ext ended by \nbanks are not as high as 24%, as claimed by the respondent/SD MC qua the \nappellant.    \n13. Accordingly, interest will be calculated at the rate of 8% per annum \n(simple).         \n14. As indicated above, the principal amount and the adverti sement tax \nwill be paid, as calculated by the respondent/SDMC, as sho wn in Table-A \nabove. \n15. As far as the other contract is concerned, it has four compon ents, \nwhich are, broadly, indicated in the Table-B above.  \n15.1 The principal amount claimed by the respondent/SDMC is Rs . \n38,16,987/-.  Likewise, advertisement tax amounting to Rs. 35, 640/- is also \nclaimed by the respondent/SDMC.  \n15.2 Besides this, the respondent/SDMC has also claimed mon ies towards \nsurcharge and interest.  \n16. Insofar as interest is concerned, for the very same reason as indicated \nhereinabove with regard to the Parking Media Contract, we are of the view \nthat interest at the rate of 8% per annum (simple) should stri ke an equitable \nDigitally Signed By:VIPIN\nKUMAR RAI\nSigning Date:27.10.2022\n17:32:25Signature Not Verified\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/004463 \n \nLPA No.99/2019                                                                                                                         Page 8 of 9 \n balance, with regard to the rights of both parties.   \n16.1 Therefore, the respondent/SDMC will calculate interest at th e rate of \n8% per annum (simple).  \n17. We may also note, that in this case as well, Mr Mittal, on  instructions, \nhas indicated to us, that the principal amount and advert isement tax, as \nshown in Table-B will be paid, along with interest, at the rate of 8% per \nannum (simple).   \n18. Insofar as payment of surcharge is concerned, it is the submi ssion of \nMr Mittal, that it has attributes of penalty. \n18.1 Mr Poddar says, that the respondent/SDMC will revisit this issue.   \n19. Mr Poddar also submits, that if it is found that the su rcharge has \nattributes of penalty, the same will be waived.     \n19.1 The statement made by Mr Poddar is taken on record. \n20. In case the respondent/SDMC were to conclude, that the surch arge \nhas not been demanded on account of non-payment of dues, and th erefore is \npayable by the appellant/Company, parties agree, that they will t ake \nrecourse to the arbitration mechanism set forth in the contract, for th e \npurpose ",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court heard LPA No.1/2021 filed by SH Vipin Bihari Sharan Dwivadi & Ors. (appellants) against the Union of India and others (respondents) challenging the order dated 3 November 2020 passed by a Single Judge in W.P.(C) No.4756/2020. The appellants, who are original petitioners in the writ petition, sought relief from coercive steps indicated in demand‑cum‑allotment letters issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for payment of flat costs. The Court, after hearing counsel and reviewing earlier orders dated 10 August 2020 (LPA31/2020) and 31 December 2020 (W.P.(C) No.11254/2020), noted the appellants’ willingness to pay the entire cost of the flats, including interest, within two weeks. The Court directed that, subject to payment within the stipulated period and without prejudice to the pending writ petition, no coercive steps shall be taken by the respondents. The order expressly excluded Appellant No.2, who had not yet been joined in the writ petition. The Court clarified that the payment would not constitute an admission of any facts and that the rights and contentions of the parties remain intact. Consequently, the appeal and related applications were disposed of, with the payment condition linked to the outcome of the pending writ petition. The judgment underscores the Court’s equitable approach, balancing the parties’ interests while preserving procedural rights pending final determination of the writ case.",
    "facts": "The appellants are original petitioners in W.P.(C) No.4756/2020, a writ petition concerning the allocation and payment of flats by the DDA. An order dated 3 November 2020 by a Single Judge directed the respondents to issue demand‑cum‑allotment letters, which the appellants contested, claiming they were coercive. The appellants filed a letters patent appeal (LPA No.1/2021) alleging dissatisfaction with the Single Judge’s order and seeking relief from the coercive steps. The respondents, represented by the Union of India, argued that the demand‑cum‑allotment process was lawful and that the appellants were liable to pay the flat cost. The Court noted that the appellants expressed readiness to pay the full amount with interest within two weeks, subject to the pending writ petition’s outcome.",
    "arguments": "Appellants argued that the demand‑cum‑allotment letters amounted to coercive action, violating their right to a fair hearing and that they should be allowed to settle the payment without prejudice to the writ petition. They also contended that the Single Judge’s order was erroneous and that the DDA’s actions were not justified. Respondents maintained that the DDA’s demand‑cum‑allotment was a statutory procedure, that the appellants were obligated to pay the flat cost, and that no relief should be granted absent a clear legal infirmity in the earlier order.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court considered the factual matrix, the parties’ willingness to settle, and the pending writ petition. It held that allowing payment without coercive steps would preserve the status quo and avoid unnecessary hardship, provided the payment is made within two weeks and does not prejudice the pending writ. The Court emphasized that such payment does not amount to an admission of liability and that the rights and contentions of the parties remain intact. The exclusion of Appellant No.2 was justified as he had not been joined in the writ petition. Accordingly, the appeal and related applications were disposed of.",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court, in W.P.(C) 18/2021 decided on 14 February 2022, set aside the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) dated 7 August 2019, which had directed fresh cadre allocation for Indian Forest Service officers based solely on a coordinate bench judgment of the High Court dated 3 May 2019. The petitioners, Union of India and others, contended that the Tribunal erred by not hearing the parties afresh, especially after the Supreme Court, in SLP (C) Nos.12430‑12431/2019, limited the relief to a narrow class of candidates and kept all questions of law open. The Court held that the Tribunal must consider the Supreme Court’s observations and conduct a merit‑based hearing on the merits. Consequently, the impugned order was set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for fresh hearing, with a deadline of 2 March 2022. The Court also ordered the deletion of respondent No.3 (Rushal Garg) from the proceedings, subject to procedural conditions. The judgment underscores the principle that higher‑court directives cannot be mechanically applied without respecting the scope of relief and the need for a fresh adjudication when legal questions remain unsettled.",
    "facts": "The petitioners challenged a CAT order that, relying on a High Court coordinate bench judgment (W.P.(C) No.109/2019), directed fresh cadre allocation for IFoS officers without a fresh hearing. The Supreme Court, in a related SLP, limited that relief to candidates who approached the Court in time and kept all legal questions open. The Tribunal, however, applied the coordinate bench judgment indiscriminately, prompting the petitioners to seek its set‑aside.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the Tribunal erred by not conducting a fresh hearing and by extending relief beyond the narrow class identified by the Supreme Court. They emphasized that the Supreme Court’s order was an exceptional accommodation, not a precedent, and that all questions of law remained open. Respondents contended that the Tribunal was correctly applying the coordinate bench direction and that the cadre allocation should proceed as ordered.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the Supreme Court’s modification limited relief to a specific group and expressly kept legal questions open, requiring a fresh merits‑based adjudication. Hence, the Tribunal could not rely solely on the coordinate bench judgment. The Court set aside the CAT order, remitted the matter for fresh hearing, and ordered the deletion of respondent No.3 subject to procedural safeguards.",

This writ petition is directed against the order dated 07.08.2019, \npassed by the Central Administrative Tribunal [in short the “Tribunal”] in \nO.A. No.1802/2019.   \n2. At the heart of the matter, is the cadre allocated to the respondents, \nwho were the original applicants before the Tribunal.  \n2.1. The Tribunal has disposed of the O.A. [i.e., O.A. No.1802/2019], \nwithout examining the rights and contentions of the parties, by relying upon \nthe judgment of the co-ordinate bench of this Court dated 03.05.2019, \npassed in a bunch of matters including W.P.(C) No.109/2019, titled \nHimanshu Kumar Verma & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.  This is evident \nupon a perusal of paragraph 6 of the impugned order. In the said paragraph, \nthe Tribunal has extracted paragraph 88 of the said decision rendered by this \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646\n \nW.P. (C) 18/2021        Pg. 2 of 6 \n Court. \n2.2. Based on the direction issued by the co-ordinate bench in the above-\nmentioned writ petition, the Tribunal has directed the petitioners to carry out \nfresh cadre allocation vis-a-vis  the respondents, who belong to the Indian \nForest Service (IFoS).   \n2.3. The Tribunal had, in effect, applied the same yardstick that the co-\nordinate bench of this Court stipulated in the aforementioned judgment. The \npetitioners were, thus, directed to make cadre allocation according to the \nmerit of the candidates, by taking into consideration the preference given by \nthe candidates irrespective of whether they had filled numerical “99” in any \nof the zones or cadres, and if a candidate was not able to get any of the \npreferred cadres as per his/her rank, cadre allocat ion qua such a candidate \ncould be made in the manner set out in later part of paragraph 4 of the Office \nMemorandum (OM) dated 05.09.2017.  The operative direction issued, in \nthis behalf, is contained in paragraph 8 of the impugned order: \n“..8. In view of these developments, we allow the O.A. in \nterms of the judgment dated 03.05.2019 in W.P. (C) \nNo.109/2019 & batch, and direct the respondents to \nundertake fresh cadre allocation of the successful candidates \nallocated to the IFoS, according to their merit and  by taking \ninto consideration the preferences given by the candidates \nirrespective of whether they have filled \"99\" in any of the \nzones or cadres. If a candidate is not able to get any of the \npreferred cadres according to his rank, cadre alloc ation in \nrespect of such a candidate may be resorted to in t he manner \nset out in later part of paragraph 4 of the O.M. dated \n05.09.2017, i.e. he may \"be allotted along with other such \ncandidates in the order of rank to any of the remaining \ncadres, 5 arranged in alphabetical order, in which there are \nvacancies in his category if allocation of all the candidates \nwho could be allotted to cadres in accordance with their \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646\n \nW.P. (C) 18/2021        Pg. 3 of 6 \n preference\"….”  \n  \n2.4. We may note that, while passing the impugned order, the Tribunal \nwas aware of the fact that the aforesaid judgment of the co-ordinate bench \ndated 03.05.2019, was carried in appeal to the Supreme Court via a Special \nLeave Petition i.e., SLP (C) Nos.12430-12431/2019, titled Ministry of \nHome Affairs v. Himanshu Kumar Verma & Ors.  The Tribunal also took \nnotice of the fact that the Supreme Court, via an order dated 17.05.2019 \npassed in the said SLP and other connected matters, had clearly held that the \nrelief  granted, would be confined to those candidates who approached the \nCourt/Tribunal in time. This aspect is noticed in paragraph 7 of the \nimpugned order.  \n2.5. It would thus be relevant, at this juncture, to extract the order dated \n17.05.2019 passed by the Supreme Court in the aforementioned SLP: - \n“Heard learned counsel for the parties at length. Permission \nto file special leave petitions is granted. In exemplary \nfairness, learned Solicitor General suggests that the 18 writ \npetitioners who had approached the High Court (one of the \nwrit petitioners being the respondent No.4 in S.L.P.(Civil) \nNos.12420-12421 of 2019, having withdrawn) and two \npetitioners, who had approached the Central Administrative \nTribunal shall be accommodated without cons idering “99” in \ntheir respective choices. This will be done by increasing one \npost in the respective State cadres this year, which will have \nto be adjusted in coming years. The suggestion is accepted by \nthe respondents. The impugned judgment and order is, \naccordingly, modified by directing the petitioners to \naccommodate the twenty trainee officers in the manner \nsuggested by the learned Advocate General. It is ma de clear \nthat such accommodation is being made as an exceptional \ncase and will not be treated as a precedent for other \ncandidates of the same batch or in future as only these 20 \npersons approached the Court/Tribunal in time. The special \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646\n \nW.P. (C) 18/2021        Pg. 4 of 6 \n leave petitions are disposed of with the above \ndirections/observations. It is made clear that all questions of \nlaw are kept open. Needless to mention that the original \ncadre allocation of the other candidates shall not be \ndisturbed .” \n \n2.6. A careful perusal of the aforementioned extract would show that the \nSupreme Court modified the judgment of the co-ordinate bench of this \nCourt, and also went on to say that the accommodation made by the \nSupreme Court had been made as an exceptional case and would not be \ntreated as a precedent for other candidates of the same batch or in future, \ngiven the fact that only 20 persons had approached the Court/Tribunal in \ntime.   \n2.7. Furthermore, more importantly, the Supreme Court also observed that \nall questions of law are kept open, and that the original cadre allocation of \nother candidates shall not be disturbed. \n3. Given this position, the Tribunal could not have simply taken recourse \nto the aforementioned judgment of the co-ordinate bench of this Court and \ndisposed of O.A. No. 1802/2019 pending before it.  \n3.1. In our opinion, since the questions of law have been kept open by the \nSupreme Court, the Tribunal would have to decide the matter on merits, \nafter hearing both parties. This is especially so, given the fact that it is not \ndisputed that the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police \nService (IPS) officers who were arrayed as parties before the Supreme Court \nbelonged to the same batch i.e., 2018 batch.  \n3.2. We may add that even Mr Asheesh Jain, learned central government \nstanding counsel, who appears for the  petitioners, does not dispute that the \norder passed by the Supreme Court, extracted above, was restricted, if at all, \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646\n \nW.P. (C) 18/2021        Pg. 5 of 6 \n to the IAS and IPS officers who were represented before the Court. \nTherefore, the Tribunal, according to both Mr Jain and Mr Ankur \nKhandelwal, who appears for the respondents, would have to examine the \nmatter, as indicated above, afresh vis-a-vis  IFoS officers.   \n4. Therefore, given the foregoing circumstances, we are of the view that \nimpugned order of the Tribunal is required to be set aside.  \n4.1. It is ordered accordingly.  \n4.2. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh hearing. It will be \nopen to the parties to advance their respective submissions before the \nTribunal.   To hasten the proceedings, parties and/or their respective counsel \nare directed to appear before the concerned bench of the Tribunal on \n02.03.2022.   \n4.3. Furthermore, we would request the Tribunal to make an endeavour to \ndispose of the case at the earliest. \n5. Before we conclude, it is required to be noticed that respondent no. 3 \ni.e., Rushal Garg was arrayed as party in the instant writ petition, even \nthough he had succeeded in his case which was lodged before the \nChandigarh Bench of the Tribunal. This aspect is recorded in the order dated \n29.04.2021. It appears that Mr Khandelwal, on instructions of respondent \nno. 3 i.e., Mr Rushal Garg, got the said respondent not only arrayed as party \nbut also have him subject himself to the interim order dated 19.01.2021 \npassed in the writ petition .   \n5.1. Therefore, at this stage, when the matter is being remanded to the \nTribunal i.e., the Principal Bench, New Delhi, Mr Khandelwal seeks to \ndelink respondent no. 3 from the matter. It is Mr Khandelwal’s submission \nthat respondent no. 3 should be allowed to file appropriate proceedings \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646\n \nW.P. (C) 18/2021        Pg. 6 of 6 \n before the Chandigarh Bench of the Tribunal.  \n5.2. While we would have no difficulty in de-linking respondent no. 3, \nhowever, given the stand that Mr Khandelwal took before the Court on \n29.04.2021 [on instructions of the said respondent], respondent no.3 can \nonly file an execution petition or a contempt petition after a decision is \nrendered in the O.A. from which the instant petitio n arises [i.e., O.A. \nNo.1802/2019]. It is ordered accordingly.  \n5.3. Thus, respondent no.3 is deleted from the array of parties, subject to \nhim abiding with the condition adverted to in paragraph 5.2 above. \n6. The writ petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.  Consequently, \npending applications shall stand closed. \n \n \n       RAJIV SHAKDHER, J  \n \n \n \n       TALWANT SINGH, J  \nFEBRUARY 14, 2022/ mr \n    Click here to check corrigendum, if any  \n \n \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000646",

    "summary": "The petitioners, parking contractors including Kake Finvest Pvt. Ltd., challenged a scheme issued by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 1 December 2020 that altered the payment of licence fees during the COVID‑19 lockdown. The scheme waived fees from 22 March to 11 September 2020 and thereafter imposed a 25% fixed fee plus a variable component linked to average total journeys compared with the previous year. Petitioners argued that the scheme should be based on passenger journeys from parking entry points, not total train journeys, and that the terms were onerous, seeking termination of contracts. DMRC explained the three categories of parking licences, the existing conciliation and arbitration mechanisms, and clarified that “total journeys” meant total passenger journeys. The Court examined the scheme, noted the waiver during lockdown as a force‑majeure measure, and found the post‑lockdown calculation reasonable. Given the presence of dispute‑resolution clauses, the Court declined to intervene under its writ jurisdiction, effectively dismissing the petitions.",
    "facts": "DMRC awarded parking contracts to various contractors. During the COVID‑19 lockdown (23 March–11 September 2020) DMRC waived licence fees. Post‑lockdown, DMRC issued a scheme charging 25% of the licence fee as a fixed amount and linking the remaining 75% to average total journeys of the previous year. Petitioners contested the calculation method and the fairness of the scheme, seeking contract termination.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that traffic reduction due to lockdown, social distancing, and work‑from‑home trends justified a more favorable fee structure and that the variable component should be based on passenger journeys from parking points. DMRC contended that the scheme was a reasonable adjustment, explained the three licence categories, and highlighted the existing conciliation and arbitration provisions.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the waiver during lockdown was a valid force‑majeure response. The clarification that “total journeys” refers to passenger journeys removed the petitioners' main grievance.

These petitions challenge the scheme awarded by the DMR C vide \nletter dated 1st December, 2020, for payment in respect of the period when \nthe Covid-19 lockdown was in effect. The case of the Petitioners  is that \nduring the lockdown period, the DMRC has granted exemption from \npayment of licence fee for the period from 23rd March, 2020 to 11th \nSeptember, 2020. Thereafter, however, a scheme has been devised for \npayment on a percentage basis, compared to the previous years ’ average \nmetro train journeys. \n4. Mr. Rakesh Tikku, ld. Sr. counsel appearing for the Petitioners \nsubmits that, on the one hand, traffic in the metro trains has not been the \nsame as what it was in the previous years. Secondly, owing to th e various \nconditions which have been imposed i.e., seats to be kept vacan t and other \nterms for social distancing, traffic in the metro trains has considerab ly \nreduced. Ld. Senior counsel also submits that the apprehension  of \ncontracting Covid-19 and the concept of ‘work from home ’ becoming the \ntrend has also considerably reduced the traffic. It is submi tted that the \nPetitioners, who are parking contractors, did not originally wish to quit but \nhad sought for much more reasonable conditions during the ti me when the \npandemic is continuing. However, now the contractors wish to  terminate the \ncontract but the DMRC is imposing very onerous terms. The final  \nsubmission is that in the proposed chart as to amounts p ayable, which has \nbeen given to the Petitioners by the DMRC, instead of takin g the average of \nthe total train journeys  from the previous year, the total number of \npassengers  ought to be taken into account.

On the other hand, Ms. Vibha Mahajan, ld. counsel appearing for t he \nDMRC submits that there are three types of tenders which were float ed in \nrespect of parking contracts.  \n• The first type was an `Old tender ’ where the period of license was \nthree years and security deposit of four months ’ licence fee was taken. \nIn the said kind of tender, four months ’ notice had to be given for \ntermination, failing which, the security deposit would b e forfeited.  \n• The second category of tenders are ‘short term licences ’ for a period \nof six months for which two months ’ licence fee is taken as security \ndeposit. If the termination is prior to six months, the secur ity deposit \nis forfeited.  \n• Final category are those which are awarded, in an `open tender \nprocess ’. The period of licence in such tenders is four years and six \nmonths ’ licence fee is to be provided as security deposit. The lock-i n \nperiod is of 12 months and after the lock-in period, 180 days ’ notice is \nto be given for termination. If termination is during the lo ck-in period \nor prior to the expiry of the 180 days’ noti ce period, the security \ndeposit is forfeited. \n6.  Ms. Mahajan, ld. counsel submits that in all three types o f contracts, \nthere are two levels of dispute resolution. Firstly, a conciliation process and \nsecondly, an arbitration mechanism. It is submitted that all  the Petitioners in \nthese cases have multiple parking contracts of one or some of the above-\nmentioned categories and are well aware of the DMRC ’s conciliation and \narbitration process. Ld. counsel finally relies upon the benefi ts given by the \nDMRC in respect of licence fee during the lockdown and submits  that the \nwaivers etc., given by DMRC are very reasonable.

On a specific query from the Court, Ms. Mahajan, ld. counsel, so ught \na clarification from Mr. Sushant Tripathi, Legal Officer, DMRC. Ld . \nCounsel then submits that the total journeys which are contemplated in the \nscheme for payment of licence fee would, in effect, be total passenger \njourneys and not total train journeys. \n8. On this clarification being given, Mr. Rakesh Tikku, ld. S r. counsel, \nsubmits in rejoinder that since payment is linked to the  average total \npassenger  journeys of the previous year, the same should be on the basis o f \npassengers who entered from the parking entry points and not otherwis e.   \n9.

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court heard a series of writ petitions filed by Kake Finvest Pvt. Ltd. and other parking contractors challenging a scheme issued by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 1 December 2020 for the payment of licence fees during the COVID‑19 lockdown. The petitioners argued that the scheme, which waived licence fees from 23 March 2020 to 11 September 2020 and thereafter linked the remaining 75 % of the fee to average passenger journeys of the previous year, was unfair because it did not reflect the drastic reduction in metro traffic and imposed onerous terms. DMRC contended that the scheme was a reasonable response to a force‑majeure event, that the fee calculation was based on total passenger journeys (not train journeys), and that the contracts contain built‑in conciliation and arbitration mechanisms for dispute resolution. The Court examined the scheme, the clarification that ‘total journeys’ meant passenger journeys, and the contractual dispute‑resolution clauses. Finding no violation of law and noting that the parties had agreed to conciliation and arbitration, the Court declined to interfere with DMRC’s scheme, effectively dismissing the writ petitions. The decision underscores the court’s reluctance to intervene in contractual matters where alternative dispute‑resolution mechanisms exist.",
    "facts": "The petitioners are parking contractors who hold licences under three types of DMRC tenders (old three‑year licences, short‑term six‑month licences, and open tender four‑year licences). During the COVID‑19 lockdown (23 Mar 2020‑11 Sep 2020) DMRC waived licence fees. Post‑lockdown, DMRC issued a scheme charging 25 % of the licence fee as a fixed amount and linking the remaining 75 % to the average total passenger journeys for the same month in the previous year. The petitioners claimed the scheme was onerous, sought a more reasonable basis for calculation, and eventually wished to terminate their contracts. DMRC argued the scheme was a reasonable adjustment to a force‑majeure situation and highlighted the contractual conciliation and arbitration clauses.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that (1) traffic had fallen dramatically due to lockdown, social distancing, and work‑from‑home trends, making the percentage‑based fee excessive; (2) the scheme should consider passenger entries from parking points rather than total train journeys; and (3) the contract terms were being imposed unilaterally, effectively forcing termination. DMRC countered that (1) the waiver period covered the worst of the pandemic; (2) the scheme uses total passenger journeys, which was clarified during hearing; and (3) the contracts contain clear dispute‑resolution mechanisms, and the fee reduction is a reasonable response to a force‑majeure event.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court noted that DMRC had expressly waived fees during the lockdown and that the post‑lockdown scheme was based on a transparent, percentage‑based calculation linked to passenger journeys, not train journeys. The clarification that ‘total journeys’ meant passenger journeys removed the petitioners’ principal objection. Moreover, the contracts provide for conciliation followed by arbitration, which the Court deemed the appropriate forum for any residual dispute. Since the scheme did not contravene any statutory provision and the parties had contractually agreed to alternative dispute resolution, the Court exercised restraint and declined to interfere, effectively dismissing the writ petitions.",

This hearing has been done by video conferencing.  \n2. The present writ petitions have been filed by various parki ng Digitally Signed By:DINESH\nSINGH NAYAL\nSigning Date:01.03.2021 15:10:52\n \nW.P.(C) 11219/2020 & connected matters  Page 2 of 11 \n contractors who have been awarded parking contracts by the Delhi  Metro \nRail Corporation (hereinafter, ‘DMRC ’).  \n3.  These petitions challenge the scheme awarded by the DMR C vide \nletter dated 1st December, 2020, for payment in respect of the period when \nthe Covid-19 lockdown was in effect. The case of the Petitioners  is that \nduring the lockdown period, the DMRC has granted exemption from \npayment of licence fee for the period from 23rd March, 2020 to 11th \nSeptember, 2020. Thereafter, however, a scheme has been devised for \npayment on a percentage basis, compared to the previous years ’ average \nmetro train journeys. \n4. Mr. Rakesh Tikku, ld. Sr. counsel appearing for the Petitioners \nsubmits that, on the one hand, traffic in the metro trains has not been the \nsame as what it was in the previous years. Secondly, owing to th e various \nconditions which have been imposed i.e., seats to be kept vacan t and other \nterms for social distancing, traffic in the metro trains has considerab ly \nreduced. Ld. Senior counsel also submits that the apprehension  of \ncontracting Covid-19 and the concept of ‘work from home ’ becoming the \ntrend has also considerably reduced the traffic. It is submi tted that the \nPetitioners, who are parking contractors, did not originally wish to quit but \nhad sought for much more reasonable conditions during the ti me when the \npandemic is continuing. However, now the contractors wish to  terminate the \ncontract but the DMRC is imposing very onerous terms. The final  \nsubmission is that in the proposed chart as to amounts p ayable, which has \nbeen given to the Petitioners by the DMRC, instead of takin g the average of \nthe total train journeys  from the previous year, the total number of \npassengers  ought to be taken into account.   Digitally Signed By:DINESH\nSINGH NAYAL\nSigning Date:01.03.2021 15:10:52\n \nW.P.(C) 11219/2020 & connected matters  Page 3 of 11 \n 5.  On the other hand, Ms. Vibha Mahajan, ld. counsel appearing for t he \nDMRC submits that there are three types of tenders which were float ed in \nrespect of parking contracts.  \n• The first type was an `Old tender ’ where the period of license was \nthree years and security deposit of four months ’ licence fee was taken. \nIn the said kind of tender, four months ’ notice had to be given for \ntermination, failing which, the security deposit would b e forfeited.  \n• The second category of tenders are ‘short term licences ’ for a period \nof six months for which two months ’ licence fee is taken as security \ndeposit. If the termination is prior to six months, the secur ity deposit \nis forfeited.  \n• Final category are those which are awarded, in an `open tender \nprocess ’. The period of licence in such tenders is four years and six \nmonths ’ licence fee is to be provided as security deposit. The lock-i n \nperiod is of 12 months and after the lock-in period, 180 days ’ notice is \nto be given for termination. If termination is during the lo ck-in period \nor prior to the expiry of the 180 days’ noti ce period, the security \ndeposit is forfeited. \n6.  Ms. Mahajan, ld. counsel submits that in all three types o f contracts, \nthere are two levels of dispute resolution. Firstly, a conciliation process and \nsecondly, an arbitration mechanism. It is submitted that all  the Petitioners in \nthese cases have multiple parking contracts of one or some of the above-\nmentioned categories and are well aware of the DMRC ’s conciliation and \narbitration process. Ld. counsel finally relies upon the benefi ts given by the \nDMRC in respect of licence fee during the lockdown and submits  that the \nwaivers etc., given by DMRC are very reasonable.

On a specific query from the Court, Ms. Mahajan, ld. counsel, so ught \na clarification from Mr. Sushant Tripathi, Legal Officer, DMRC. Ld . \nCounsel then submits that the total journeys which are contemplated in the \nscheme for payment of licence fee would, in effect, be total passenger \njourneys and not total train journeys. \n8. On this clarification being given, Mr. Rakesh Tikku, ld. S r. counsel, \nsubmits in rejoinder that since payment is linked to the  average total \npassenger  journeys of the previous year, the same should be on the basis o f \npassengers who entered from the parking entry points and not otherwis e.   \n9.

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court heard appeals (MAC.APP.286/2020 and MAC.APP.3/2021) filed by Ashok Kumar Chaudhary against orders granting recovery rights to an insurance company. The appellant contended that the trial court erred in holding him liable because the genuineness of the driver’s licence had been verified at the time of employment, and no evidence suggested the licence was invalid. The respondent insurance company conceded the licence verification but did not object to limiting the award. The High Court examined the impugned award dated 04.03.2020, which held that the vehicle owner failed to prove the driver’s licence was valid. Finding no material to show the licence was invalid, the Court set aside the award and the associated recovery rights of the insurer. Consequently, the appeals were allowed, directing the tribunal to refund amounts deposited by the appellant and to restore statutory deposits. The order was to be uploaded on the Court’s website and communicated to counsel. The judgment underscores the principle that recovery cannot be awarded where the plaintiff fails to establish a crucial factual element, such as the validity of a driver’s licence, especially when verification records exist.",
    "facts": "Ashok Kumar Chaudhary (appellant) was subject to an order granting recovery rights to an insurance company, based on the finding that the vehicle owner failed to prove the driver held a valid licence. The appellant argued that the driving licence had been verified at the time of employment (report dated 17.07.2013) and that there was no evidence of its invalidity. The insurance company acknowledged the verification but did not contest limiting the award.",
    "arguments": "The appellant’s counsel argued that the trial court’s reasoning was flawed because the licence’s genuineness had already been verified, making any further evidence unnecessary. He asserted there was no material indicating the licence was invalid. The respondent’s counsel conceded the verification and raised no objection to a limited award, effectively supporting the appellant’s position that the recovery rights should be curtailed.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the impugned award, which found the appellant failed to prove the driver’s licence validity, was unsustainable given the verification report and lack of contrary material. Consequently, the award and the insurance company’s recovery rights were set aside. The Court ordered the refund of amounts deposited by the appellant and the restitution of statutory deposits, emphasizing that recovery cannot be granted without proof of a material fact.",

      "Verification of a driver’s licence at the time of employment is conclusive unless contradicted by evidence.",
      "Recovery rights cannot be awarded where the plaintiff fails to prove a crucial factual element.",

Appellant impugns order dated 04.03.2020 whereby recovery \nrights have been held to be maintainable against the appellant. \n3. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the rational e \ngiven in the impugned order is that the appellant has fai led to plead in \nhis written statement, that the genuineness of the driving license was \nverified at the time of giving an employment and as such any evidence \nled before the Court on the said aspect could not be considered. \n4. Learned counsel refers to the report dated 17.07.2013 available \non the Trial Court record which has verified the genuineness of the \ndriving license.  \n5. Learned counsel further submits that there is no material on \nrecord to show that the driving license was not valid and as  such there \nwas no necessity of the appellant to even plead the same. \n6. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Insurance \nCompany under instructions concedes that the driving licence had \nbeen duly verified and submits that he has no objection t o the \nmodification of the impugned award to the limited extent th at it grants \nrecovery rights to the insurance company against the petitioner.  \n7. In view of the above, the impugned award dated 04.03.2020, to \nthe limited extent that it holds that the owner of the veh icle has failed \nto prove that the driver was having a valid and effective licence,  is set \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/000684\n \n \nMAC.APP. 286/2020 & MAC.APP.  3/2021  Page 3 of 3  \n \n aside.

The petitioners, represented by Ms. Pallavi Awasthi, claimed they were similarly situated to the earlier petitioners and had filed the requisite No Objection Certificates. The respondents, Union of India, argued that verification of entitlement and the right to appeal to the Supreme Court should be preserved. The Court, after video‑conferenced hearing, directed the Indian Air Force to verify the petitioners' claims within twelve weeks and, if verified, to pay arrears of pro rata pension from the date of discharge, continue future payments, and pay interest at 7% per annum on delayed amounts. If verification finds any petitioner ineligible, written reasons must be communicated, allowing the petitioner to seek further remedies. The order was to be uploaded online and communicated to counsel. The judgment essentially disposes of the petitions by granting them the same relief as in the earlier cases, subject to verification.",
    "facts": "Former armed forces personnel Shivashish Shubham, Pradeep Chandra Nahak and Vipin Kumar Yadav filed writ petitions claiming entitlement to pro rata pension. They asserted that they were in the same position as petitioners in the Brijlal Kumar and Govind Kumar Srivastava cases, for which the Court had previously ordered payment of pro rata pension. The petitioners submitted No Objection Certificates and sought the same relief—payment of arrears and continuation of pro rata pension. The Union of India, as respondent, contended that verification of eligibility and the right to appeal to the Supreme Court must be preserved.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the factual circumstances of their service and discharge were analogous to those in the earlier judgments, thereby warranting identical relief. They emphasized that they had complied with procedural requirements, including filing NOCs. Respondents argued that each case must be individually verified to ensure eligibility and that the petitioners should retain the right to appeal any adverse verification decision to the Supreme Court.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the petitioners' claims closely mirror those in the Brijlal Kumar and Govind Kumar Srivastava cases, where pro rata pension was granted. However, it stressed the necessity of verification to confirm eligibility, preserving the respondents' right to appeal adverse findings. Accordingly, the Court directed the Indian Air Force to verify the petitioners' status within twelve weeks and, upon verification, to award arrears and future pro rata pension, with interest for delayed payment.

    "summary": "The appeal (LPA 4/2021) filed by National Textile Corporation Ltd. challenges a single judge's order directing the release of the respondent S B Singh's leave encashment and the employer's share of provident fund (PF) while disciplinary proceedings are pending. The single judge had held that, absent an express opinion that the amount could be recovered from the respondent, the leave encashment could not be withheld. The appellant argued that Rule 25.13 of the Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 2009, which treats disciplinary proceedings instituted before retirement as continuing post‑superannuation, should preclude withholding of any retiral benefits, including leave encashment. The court examined the leave rules, which specifically govern withholding of leave encashment, and held that they are the controlling provision; the disciplinary rules cannot override them without express provision. Consequently, the direction to release the leave encashment was upheld, while the order to release the employer's share of PF was stayed pending further consideration of the disciplinary proceedings. The court also noted timing issues regarding the exact moment of superannuation and the issuance of the show‑cause notice, directing the parties to expedite the disciplinary inquiry.",
    "facts": "S B Singh, a senior employee of National Textile Corporation Ltd., retired (superannuated) on 31 January 2020. A show‑cause notice dated 31 January 2020 was issued on 1 February 2020, initiating disciplinary proceedings for alleged misconduct. The respondent sought release of his retiral benefits – gratuity, leave encashment, and PF – via a writ petition. The single judge directed the appellant to release the leave encashment and employer's share of PF, holding that no express opinion existed to justify withholding the leave encashment. The appellant appealed, contending that Rule 25.13 of its Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 2009, should allow withholding of all retiral benefits until disciplinary proceedings conclude, and that the proceedings were instituted before retirement.",
    "arguments": "Appellant: Asserted that Rule 25.13 treats disciplinary proceedings instituted before retirement as continuing post‑superannuation, thereby permitting withholding of all retiral benefits, including leave encashment and PF. Cited the timing of the show‑cause notice and internal notes to argue the proceedings were instituted before superannuation. Respondent: Relied on the Leave Rules, 2015, which require an express opinion in the order to withhold leave encashment. Pointed to precedents (Satya Prakash v. BSNL and Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Prem Nath Manchanda) stating that withholding is permissible only with a clear finding of recoverable amount.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court held that leave encashment is governed exclusively by the Leave Rules, 2015, which stipulate that withholding is permissible only if the order expressly states a possibility of recovery. Since the single judge’s order lacked such an opinion, the appellant could not withhold the leave encashment. The Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 2009, cannot be used to override the specific provisions of the Leave Rules absent an express cross‑reference. Regarding PF, the court stayed the release of the employer's share pending further determination of the disciplinary proceedings. The timing of superannuation and issuance of the show‑cause notice was noted but left for detailed consideration.",

JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL  \n     JUDGMENT  \nAMIT BANSAL, J. (Oral)   \n  \n1. On 5th January, 2021, when this appeal first came up for \nconsideration, the following order was passed:- \n3.  The appeal impugns the judgment dated 17th November, \n2020 of the Single Judge in W.P.(C) No.3114/2020 instituted by \nthe respondent, seeking a mandamus directing the appellant  to \nrelease the retiral benefits comprising of gratuity, leave \nencashment and provident fund (PF) to the respondent. Dur ing \nthe pendency of the petition, the respondent‟s share of PF was \nreleased to the respondent, with the appella nt‟s share of PF \namount only being retained/withheld. Further, though the  \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 2 of 10  \n respondent, in the writ petition had sought release of  gratuity \nalso, but during the hearing before the Single Judge, ga ve up \nthe relief of release of gratuity and agreed to the same b eing \nwithheld by the appellant, till the culmination of the disciplinar y \nproceedings initiated against the respondent. Thus, only t he \nclaim for release of leave encashment amount and the \nemployer‟s share of PF amount remained for adjudication  \nbefore the Single Judge and the Single Judge, vide the \nimpugned judgment has directed the appellant to release bo th \nthe said amounts to the respondent. Aggrieved therefrom, t his \nappeal has been preferred.  \n4.  We have heard the counsel for the appellant as well as \nthe counsel for the respondent, appearing on advance noti ce, at \nlength.  \n5.  We will first deal with the impugned direction of the  \nSingle Judge, insofar as it concerns the release of the lea ve \nencashment amount. Leave encashment of the employees of the \nappellant is governed by the National Textile Corporation \nLimited Leave Rules, 2015 and Rule 7 whereof deals with Leave  \nEncashment. Rule 7.7 inter alia permits the authority competen t \nto grant encashment of leave, to withhold whole or part  of cash \nequivalent of earned leave, in case of any employee who retires \nfrom service on attaining the age of superannuation, while \nunder suspension or while disciplinary or criminal proceed ings \nare pending against him, if in the view of such authori ty there is \npossibility of some money becoming recoverable from him on \nconclusion of the proceedings against him. The Single Judge, in \nthe impugned judgment has held that since there was no finding \nreturned or opinion expressed in the order withholding th e \namount of leave encashment, of a possibility of some m oney \nbecoming recoverable from the respondent on conclusion of the \ndisciplinary proceedings initiated against him, the amou nt due \ntowards leave encashment could not be withheld. Relianc e was \nplaced on Satya Prakash Vs. Chairman Cum Managing \nDirector, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. 2019 SCC OnLine Del \n8039 and Govt. of NCT of Delhi Through Chief Secretary Vs.  \nPrem Nath Manchanda 2018 SCC OnLine 13066, laying down \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 3 of 10  \n that for leave encashment amount to be withheld, there has to \nbe an express opinion in the order withholding the leave  \nencashment amount, of such possibility and which did no t exist \nin the present case.  \n6.  The counsel for the appellant has not impugned the \naforesaid reasoning. He has however drawn our attention to the \nConduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 2009 of the appel lant, \nRule 25.13 titled “Continuation of Enquiry Beyond \nSuperannuation” whereof inter alia provides, that (i) \ndisciplinary proceedings, if instituted while the employee was  in \nservice, whether before his retirement or during his re-\nemployment, shall, after the final retirement of the employee, be \ndeemed to be subsisting and shall be continued and concl uded \nby the authority by which it was commenced, in the same \nmanner as if the employee had continued in service; and, (ii ) in \nsuch cases, the employee will cease to be in service from the \ndate of superannuation/retirement but will not be entitle d to \npayment of retirement benefits till the proceedings are \ncompleted and final order is passed thereon, except his own \ncontribution to Contributory Provident Fund.  \n7.  The counsel for the appellant has contended that th e \nimpugned judgment does not consider that the word „insti tuted‟ \nused in the aforesaid Rule 25.13.1 and which word has b een \nheld to mean, the date when a decision to initiate disciplin ary \nproceedings has been taken. He has contended that since in t he \npresent case, though Show Cause Notice dated 31st January,  \n2020 was served on the respondent on 1st February, 2020 i.e. \nvery next day of his superannuation on 31st January, 2020 , but \nthe disciplinary proceeding against the respondent is deem ed to \nhave been instituted on 31st January, 2020 i.e. during his \nemployment with the appellant; it is stated that till 31st  \nJanuary, 2020 the respondent was in the employment of the \nappellant. \n8.  We have enquired from the counsel for the appellant, \nwhether leave encashment can be considered as a retiral  \nbenefit. \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 4 of 10  \n 9. The counsel for the appellant has referred us to Rule 7 \naforesaid of the Leave Rules and on a reading whereof we a re \nsatisfied that the leave encashment, as per the said rule, is a \nretiral benefit. \n10. The contention of the counsel for the appellant is that the \nSingle Judge has not considered that besides the Leave Rules , \nthe aforesaid Rule 25.13 of Conduct, Discipline and App eal \nRules would also apply. \n11. We are unable to agree. Leave encashment, though a \nretiral benefit, having been dealt with separately, under t he \nLeave Rules which lay down their own condition/s for \nwithholding of leave encashment, we are of the view that no \ncase of the appellant being entitled to withhold the leave \nencashment amount, also as a retiral benefit, under R ule 25.13, \nis made out. To withhold the amount of leave encashment, t he \nprovisions of the Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules , cannot \nbe applied, without the Leave Rules, expressly providing so. N o \nground to interfere with the direction of the Single Judg e, to the \nappellant, to release the leave encashment amount to the \nrespondent, is thus made out and the appeal to that exte nt, is \ndismissed. \n12. We however find merit in the contention of the counsel \nfor the appellant, that the Single Judge has not consider ed that \nthe disciplinary proceedings in the present case were insti tuted \nprior to retirement of the respondent. We have however \nenquired, whether the retirement / superannuation of the \nrespondent was in the forenoon or afternoon of 31st January, \n2020 and whether any such thing is mentioned/specified i n the \nrecords, as is found in cases of certain other department s, \nparticularly Armed Forces. If it is so, and the \nretirement/superannuation of the respondent were to be in t he \nforenoon and the decision to initiate disciplinary procee ding \nwas taken in the afternoon, then also, what is argued by th e \ncounsel for the appellant, will not follow inasmuch as th e \ninstitution of the disciplinary proceeding would be after  the \nsuperannuation of the respondent. \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 5 of 10  \n 13. We have also enquired from the counsel for the \nappellant, whether not institution of a legal proceedi ng in a \nCourt is different from institution of a disciplinary proceeding, \nbecause unlike a proceeding in the Court, which is deemed to \nbe instituted on the date of filing in the Court, a discipl inary \nproceeding commences with the issuance of a show cause notice \nand which is a 'communication' within the meaning of Sectio ns \n3 & 4 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and if it is so, t hen even \nif a decision is taken to institute the proceedings, unless the said \ndecision is communicated to the employee, it cannot be said that \nthe disciplinary proceedings were instituted prior to \nretirement/superannuation of the employee. \n14. The Single Judge has held that the disciplinary \nproceedings in the present case were initiated after \nsuperannuation and in which case there is no power to withhold \nthe retiral benefits. \n15. Though we have heard the counsels for some time but it \nappears that decision on the said aspect requires consider ation \nand preparation by the counsels. \n16. Issue notice of the appeal qua the aforesaid aspect of \npayment of the appellant‟s share of P F to the respondent, \nduring the pendency of disciplinary proceedings. \n17. Notice is accepted by the counsel for the respondent.  \n18. List for hearing on 18th March, 2021. \n19. Till further orders, the direction of the Single Judg e in \nthe impugned judgment, to the extent of directing the a ppellant \nto release appellant‟s share  of PF to the respondent, shall \nremain stayed. \n20. Pendency of this appeal to not come in the way of \nexpeditious disposal of the disciplinary proceeding, which  we \nare informed, under the Rules are required to be completed \nwithin four to five months. The appellant is directed to en sure \ntimely conduct of the disciplinary proceeding, within the time \nstipulated in the Rules and the respondent is directed to  \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 6 of 10  \n cooperate in the same. The status of the disciplinary proceedin g \nbe also informed on the next date. \n \n2. Our attention has been drawn by the counsel for the appel lant to the \nOffice Order dated 19th February, 2020, which states that the respondent, on \nattaining the age of superannuation, has b een superannuated “ on closing \nhours of 31st January, 2020 ”. As per counsel for the appellant, „closing \nhours‟ would mean 06:00 PM on 31st January, 2020. Our attention is also \ndrawn by the counsel for appellant to the note-sheet dated 31st January, 2020 \nin the files maintained by the appellant, wherein the following is noted:-  \n “In this regard it is informed that, vide note dated 31.01.2020 \n(sent to Sr. Manager (HR) from the Office of CVO NTC Ltd. \nIn the forenoon), you have already been informed to issue \nCharge sheet to Sh. S.B. Singh, CGM (Fin/MIS) in the above \nsaid matter. ”  \n \n3. The counsel for the appellant has also placed reliance on an other \nnoting dated 31st January, 2020 handed over in the course of the hearing, \nwherein CMD of the appellant Corporation has signed the Memoran dum of \nCharge to be served on the respondent on 31st January, 2020.  \n4. The counsel for appellant thus contends that the Single Judge, in the \nimpugned judgment, has wrongly concluded that the respondent  \nsuperannuated on 31st January, 2020 and till that time no charge-sheet was \nissued to him.  \n5.  The counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the rel evant \nprovisions of the Rules, which are set out below:- \nSigned By:ASHWANI\nSigning Date:05.04.2021\n09:54:52Signature Not Verified\n \nLPA 4/2021                             Page 7 of 10  \n           “25.13 Continuation of inquiry beyond Superannuation:  \n25.13.1.

    "summary": "The petitioners (Union of India and Anr.) challenged a Delhi High Court order dated 11‑07‑2017 that allowed the respondent, Pyare Lal, to receive Non‑Functional Upgradation (NFU) to the grade of Additional Secretary (HAG) effective 01‑01‑2014. The respondent, a former Chief Engineer (Electrical) who superannuated on 31‑03‑2014, had applied for NFU but was initially rejected because he lacked the requisite one‑year qualifying service as on the crucial date of 01‑01‑2013. The Tribunal, relying on Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) guidelines, held that the respondent could be considered for NFU in the subsequent vacancy year after completing the qualifying service by 01‑04‑2014. Petitioners argued that the Tribunal erred by not producing the governing rule and relied merely on FAQs. They cited an Office Memorandum (OM) dated 28‑05‑2014, which altered the crucial date for financial‑year‑based vacancies to 01‑April, but the Court found this OM inapplicable to the respondent’s case as it pertained only to vacancy years commencing from 2015‑16 onward. The Court held that the earlier OM of 17‑09‑1998, which fixed the crucial date at 01‑January, governed the respondent’s situation. Consequently, the Tribunal’s order was consistent with the applicable rule, and the petition was dismissed with the pending application disposed. Petitioners were directed to implement the Tribunal’s order within six weeks.",
    "facts": "The respondent was appointed Assistant Executive Engineer in 1981, promoted through the ranks, and became Chief Engineer (Electrical) on 20‑03‑2012. He superannuated on 31‑03‑2014. He sought NFU in the grade of Additional Secretary (HAG) but was rejected because he did not have one year of qualifying service as on the crucial date 01‑01‑2013. The respondent filed an Original Application, which the Tribunal allowed, directing NFU effective 01‑01‑2014. Petitioners appealed, contending the Tribunal’s decision was unsupported by any rule or memorandum and relied on FAQs.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the Tribunal failed to produce the statutory rule governing eligibility for NFU and merely relied on FAQs, rendering its decision unsustainable. They cited the OM dated 28‑05‑2014, which shifted the crucial date for financial‑year‑based vacancies to 01‑April, asserting that the respondent should be considered eligible based on service completed by 01‑April‑2014. The respondent contended that, despite lacking one year of service as on 01‑01‑2013, he possessed the requisite service by 01‑01‑2014 and thus was entitled to NFU. The Tribunal held that the respondent’s eligibility should be assessed under the earlier OM of 17‑09‑1998, which fixed the crucial date at 01‑January for financial‑year‑based vacancies, making the respondent ineligible for the 2014‑15 vacancy but eligible for the subsequent year, thereby justifying the order.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the chronology of Office Memoranda. The OM dated 28‑05‑2014 applied only to vacancy years commencing from 2015‑16 and therefore could not govern the respondent’s case, which pertained to the 2014‑15 vacancy year. The earlier OM of 17‑09‑1998, incorporated by reference in the 28‑05‑2014 OM, remained the controlling rule for the period in question, fixing the crucial date at 01‑January. Accordingly, the respondent’s lack of one year of qualifying service as on 01‑January‑2014 rendered him ineligible for NFU for that vacancy year, but the Tribunal correctly allowed his application for the subsequent vacancy year after he completed the requisite service. The Court found no infirmity in the Tribunal’s reasoning and dismissed the petition.",

Respondent gave a representation seeking grant of  Non -\nFunctional Upgradation in the grade of Additional Se cretary (HAG), \nwhich was rejected on the ground that he was not fou nd eligible as he did \nnot complete  the requisite qualifying service  of one year  as Chief Engineer \non the crucial date i.e., 01.01.2013.  \n3. As noticed hereinabove, respondent was  promoted to the post of \nChief Engineer (Electrical) on 20.03.2012  and on  01.01.2013 , he did not \nhave the qualifying service of one year and thereaf ter, superannuated on \n31.03.2014 . The rejection letter dated 27.03.2014  referred to DoP &T \nclarification dated 09.09.2010 to state that if a n officer did not meet the \neligibility requirement as on 1st January of the corresponding vacancy year \nthen he is to be considered for grant of Non -Functional Upgradation in the \nsubsequent year on completion of qualifying service  w.e.f., 1st April of the \nnext vacancy year.  \n4. The Tribunal in the impugned order has noticed that  similar \nsubmission was made by the petitioner, however, pet itioner could not \nproduce the relevant rule or office memorandum dire cting so. Reference \nwas drawn to answer to certain  Frequen tly Asked Questions (FAQ). The \nTribunal rejected the reference of the petitioners to the FAQs  on the \nground that petitioners were merely relying on answ er to an FAQ and had \nnot been able to produce any rule to the said effec t. \n5. The contention of the respondent was that though re spondent did \nnot have one year of qualifying service of 01.01.2013, he did possess  one \nyear qualifying service o n 01.01.2014  and superannuated only on \n31.03.2014  and as such was entitled to grant of Non -Functional \nDigitally Signed\nBy:VINOD KUMAR\nSigning Date:24.11.2022\n16:31:17Signature Not Verified\nNeutral Citation Number 2022/DHC/005094  \n \n   W.P.(C) 1600/2019                                                                                                                          3 Upgradation.  \n6. Referen ce may be have to the Office Memorandum (‘OM’) dated \n28.05.2014, which is relied upon by the petitioner.  The OM dated \n28.05.2014, inter alia , reads as under :  \n“No.22011/6/2013- Estt(D)  \nGovernment of India \nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions \n(Department of Personnel and Training) \n \nNorth Block, New Delhi \nDated the 28th May, 2014 \n \n        OFFICE MEMORANDUM  \nSubject: - Eligibility of officers to be considered for promotion by DPC - \nFixing of Crucial Date - Regarding.  \n     *** \nThe undersigned is d irected to invite reference to the Department \nof Personnel and Training's Office Memorandum No. 22011/3/98 -Estt(D) \ndated September 17, 1998 regarding subject mentioned above, which \nprovides that the crucial date for determining eligibility for promotion in  \ncase of financial year -based vacancy year would fall on January 1, \nimmediately preceding such vacancy year and in case of calendar year -\nbased vacancy year also, the first day of the vacancy year i.e.1st January \nitself would be the crucial date. \n2. In case  of financial year -based vacancy year, there is a clear gap \nof 3 months between the crucial date of eligibility and the date of \ncommencement of vacancy year i.e. between January 1 and April 1. Due to \nthis gap, for any such vacancy year, even if the Departmental Promotion \nCommittee (DPC) meeting is held in time as per the Model Calendar, there \nis always a possibility of few officers not fulfillin g the eligibility criteria as \non the crucial date of eligibility, though they are fulfilling the same as on \nthe da te of commencement of the vacancy year.  \n3. The matter has been examined in consultation with Union Public \nService Commission. It has been decided that the crucial d ate of eligibility \nshall be 1st April of the vacancy year in case of financial year based \nvacancy year i.e. where the Annual Performance Appraisal Reports \n(APARs) are written financial year -wise.

    "summary": "The petition filed by City Lifeline Travels Private Limited (the petitioner) seeks appointment of a sole arbitrator to resolve payment disputes arising from a Water Tanker Supply Services contract for Zone‑II entered into with Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on 27‑08‑2012. After the petitioner’s bid was accepted, DJB issued a Letter of Intent and a Work Order, but later failed to release payments for August‑October 2020. The petitioner invoked the arbitration clause (Clause 8.1.2) and served a notice on 20‑11‑2012, proposing a former Chief Justice as arbitrator. DJB rejected the proposal and suggested two alternative former judges, which the petitioner also rejected. DJB subsequently nominated Justice (Retd) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari, one of its own suggestions, as sole arbitrator. The petitioner challenged this unilateral appointment under Section 11(6) of the A&C Act, arguing it contravenes the contractual procedure and citing Supreme Court decisions in Perkins Eastman Architects and TRF Ltd. The respondent contended those precedents were inapplicable, relying on Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls cases. The Court examined the contractual clause, the statutory framework, and the cited jurisprudence, concluding that DJB’s unilateral nomination was permissible where the parties could not agree within one month, and thus allowed the petition for appointment of the arbitrator. The judgment underscores the primacy of contractual arbitration clauses and the limited scope of judicial intervention under Section 11(6).",
    "facts": "The parties entered into a contract on 27‑08‑2012 for water tanker supply services in Zone‑II. The petitioner performed the work but DJB failed to pay invoices for August‑October 2020. The petitioner issued a notice invoking the arbitration clause on 20‑11‑2012 and suggested a former Chief Justice as arbitrator. DJB rejected the suggestion, proposed two former judges, and later nominated Justice (Retd) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari as sole arbitrator. The petitioner filed an application under Section 11(6) of the A&C Act seeking appointment of an arbitrator and interim relief, which was denied, leading to an appeal under Section 37.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that DJB’s unilateral appointment violated Clause 8.1.2, which requires mutual consent and that the DJB’s suggested arbitrators were from its own panel, rendering the appointment improper. The petitioner relied on Supreme Court rulings in Perkins Eastman Architects and TRF Ltd. to assert that an ineligible arbitrator cannot be appointed. Respondent countered that those decisions dealt with Section 12(5) ineligibility and a different procedural context, and that under the contract DJB retained the right to nominate an arbitrator if parties failed to agree within one month. The respondent cited Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls to support the validity of unilateral nomination from a pre‑existing panel.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the wording of Clause 8.1.2, which expressly provides that if parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within one month, DJB may nominate one. The statutory framework of Section 11(6) supports court‑assisted appointment only when the agreed procedure fails. Since the contract already vested DJB with the power to nominate after the one‑month period, the Court held that DJB’s nomination of Justice Ansari was in accordance with the contract and the A&C Act. The cited precedents were distinguished on factual and procedural grounds; they did not preclude DJB’s right to nominate from its panel. Consequently, the petition for appointment of a sole arbitrator was allowed.",

The respondent (hereafter ‘DJB’) issued a Request for Proposal \n(RFP) bearing NIT No.07/RPC-I/(2011-12) inviting competitive \ntenders from agencies for operating Stainless Steel (SS) Water Tanker \nServices on hire basis for the purposes of supplying water throug h \nvehicle mounted water tankers in order to facilitate supply of p otable \ndrinking water to different areas in Delhi.  Such services were to be \nprovided in five different Zones – Zone I, Zone II, Zone V, Zone VII \nand Zone VIII on identical terms. The subject dispute relates to Z one \nII. \n3. The petitioner submitted its bid pursuant to the RFP. After \nnegotiations, an offer made by the petitioner was accepted and the \nDJB issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) dated 16.07.2012.  Thereaft er, the \nDJB issued a Work Order under the cover of its letter dated \n21.08.2012 and on 27.08.2012, the parties entered into a form al \nagreement with respect to performance of the work “ Water Tanker \nSupply Services (WTSS) for Zone- II”. \n4. The petitioner claims that it has been diligently performing th e \ncontract, however, the DJB has failed to make payments of the \ninvoices raised by the petitioner.  The petitioner claims tha t it had \nissued a notice calling upon the DJB to release the payments \noutstanding for the months of August, September and October, 20 20 \nand had also made representations in this regard.  However, the \npetitioner claims that the DJB has failed to address the issues rai sed by \nit.  \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 3 of 13  \n 5. In view of the disputes that have arisen between the parties, the  \npetitioner issued a notice dated 20.11.2012 invoking the A rbitration \nAgreement as set out in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract.  It also suggested \nthe name of a former Chief Justice of this Court for being appointed as \nan Arbitrator.   \n6. Thereafter, on 25.11.2020, the petitioner filed a petition (OMP \n(I) (COMM.) 392/2020) under Section 9 of the A&C Act before this  \nCourt seeking certain interim measures of protection.  The said matt er \nwas listed for hearing on 01.12.2020 and 02.12.2020.  On 02. 12.2020, \nthis Court issued notice but did not grant any interim relief, as prayed \nfor by the petitioner. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner preferred \nan appeal –  FAO(OS)(COMM.) 173/2020 – under Section 37 of the \nA&C Act impugning the said order dated 02.12.2020.   \n7. The name of the Sole Arbitrator as suggested by the petitioner \nwas not accepted by the DJB.  However, the DJB sent a letter dated \n15.12.2020 responding to the petitioner’s notice dated 20 .11.2020, \nwhereby the petitioner had invoked the Arbitration Clause. Th e DJB \nproposed names of two persons, one being a former Chief Justice of \nthe Patna High Court and the other being a former Judge of this Co urt \nto be appointed as Arbitrators. However, the same were not acceptable \nto the petitioner. Therefore, on 24.12.2020, the petitioner m oved this \napplication for appointment of an Arbitrator.   \n8. After the petitioner had filed the present application, the DJB \nissued a letter dated 31.12.2020 nominating Justice (Retired) Iq bal \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 4 of 13  \n Ahmed Ansari as a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between \nthe parties. It is material to note that he was one of the two persons \nwho were proposed by the DJB for being appointed as an Arbitr ator, \nin its letter dated 15.12.2020  \n9. The respondent does not dispute the existence of the Arbitration  \nClause contained in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract is relev ant and is set \nout below:-  \n“8.1 DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n1) Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this \nAgreement shall in the first instance be dealt with in \naccordance with the escalation procedure as set out \nin the Governance Schedule.   \n2) Any dispute or difference whatsoever arising \nbetween to this Contract out of or relating to the \nconstruction, meaning, scope, operation or effect of \nthis Contract or the validity of the breach thereof, \nwhich cannot be resolved through the application of \nthe provisions of the Governance Schedule, shall be \nreferred to a sole Arbitrator to be appointed by \nmutual consent of both the parties herein.  If the \nparties cannot agree on the appointment of the \nArbitrator within a period of one month from the \nnotification by one party to the other of existence of \nsuch dispute, then the Arbitrator shall be nominated \nby DJB.  The provisions of the Arbitration and \nConciliation Act, 1996 will be applicable and the \naward made there under shall be final and binding \nupon the parties hereto, subject to legal remedies \navailable under the law.  Such differences shall be \ndeemed to be a submission to arbitration under the \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 5 of 13  \n Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or of \nany modifications, Rules or re-enactments thereof.  \nThe Arbitration proceedings will be held at Delhi, \nIndia. ” \n10. Ms. Arora, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner referred \nto the decisions of the Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman Architects \nDPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited : Arbitration Application No 32 \nof 2019 decided on 26.11.2019 and a decision of this Court in \nProddatur Cable TV Digi Services v. Citi Cable Network Li mited: \n(2020) 267 DLT 51  and contended that the unilateral appointment of \nan Arbitrator by the DJB was not permissible.   \n11. Mr Singh, learned counsel appearing for the DJB countered the \naforesaid submissions.  He contended that the decision of th e Supreme \nCourt in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) \nLimited (supra ) was not applicable in the facts of the present case.  He \nsubmitted that the said decision must be read in a restricte d manner. \nAnd, the said decision would be applicable only in cases under Section \n11(6)(a) of the A&C Act, that is, in cases where there had been failure \non the part of a party to act in accordance with the agreed procedure \nfor appointment of an Arbitrator.   \n12. He submitted that the said decision must also be read in c ontext \nwith an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo \nEngineering Projects Ltd.: (2017) 8 SCC 377 .  He submitted that in \nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited \n(supra ), the issue before the Court was regarding ineligibility of an \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 6 of 13  \n Arbitrator to act as such under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act.  He  \nsubmitted that there was no dispute that a person whose relati onship \nwith any of the parties fell within the categories as specifie d in the \nSeventh Schedule of the A&C Act would be ineligible to be appoi nted \nas an Arbitrator.  He submitted that the said rationale was furth er \nextended by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering \nProjects Ltd. (supra ) and the Supreme Court held that once a person is \nineligible by operation of law to act as an Arbitrator, he also cannot \nnominate another to nominate an Arbitrator.  The Court had held  that \n“it was inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible \ncan nominate a person .” Mr. Singh submitted that the said decision \nwas rendered in context of an Arbitration Clause, which provid ed that \ndisputes and differences between the parties would be referred to \n“sole arbitration of the Managing Director of buyer or h is nominee” .  \nHe submitted that in the case of Perkins Eastman Architects DPC & \nAnr. v. HSCC (India) Limited (supra ), the Arbitration Clause \nprovided for an arbitration “by a sole arbitrator appointed by the \nCMD HSCC within 30 days from the receipt of the request”.   \nHowever, the CMD, HSCC, had failed to appoint an Arbitrator with in \nthe period specified and therefore, the concerned authority had lo st its \nright to appoint an Arbitrator.  He submitted that the decisi on was also \nfounded on Section 12(5) of the A&C Act which, inter alia, rendered \nan employee of any party ineligible to act as an Arbitrator.  Th us, the \nsaid decisions would not be applicable in the present case.  \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 7 of 13  \n 13. He earnestly contended that in the facts of the present case, the \nDJB had appointed a former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court as  \nan Arbitrator from the panel of Arbitrators maintained by it and  \ntherefore, the question of an Arbitrator being ineligible under Section \n12(5) of the A&C Act did not arise.  He relied on the decision of the  \nSupreme Court in Central Organization for Railway Electrification v. \nECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML : Civil Appeal Nos. 9486-9487 of 2019 \ndecided on 17.12.2019 and contended that in cases where an \nArbitrator has been appointed from a panel of Arbitrators, the \nappointment was necessarily required to be in terms of the agreement \nbetween the parties.  He submitted that in this case, the DJB had a \nright to nominate an Arbitrator and therefore, the appointment o f the \nArbitrator could not be faulted.  He also referred to the decision of the \nSupreme Court in Standard Corrosion Controls Pvt. Ltd.  v. Sarku \nEngineering Services SDN BHD: (2009) 1 SCC 303  and contended \nthat a party could not approach the court under Section 11 of the A&C \nAct without following the procedure as agreed upon.  \n14. Ms Arora countered the aforesaid submissions.  She submitted \nthat the contention that the Arbitrators suggested by the  DJB were \nfrom its panel is incorrect.  She also referred to an Office Order bein g \nOO No.26 dated 17.12.2020, issued by the Office of the Law Officer, \nDJB and submitted that the said Office Order, for including the  names \nof two former Judges suggested by the DJB on their panel, was issued \non 17.12.2020 which was after the date when their names had b een \nsuggested by the DJB.   \n \n  \nARB.P.1/2021                                          Page 8 of 13  \n 15. She also referred to a circular dated 25.08.2020, which sets out \nthe procedure to be adopted for appointment of an Arbitral Tr ibunal in \nlight of the judgments passed by the Supreme Court and the High  \nCourt.  The said circular indicates that the concerned engineering \nofficer is required to file a request to the High Court for appoint ment \nof an Arbitrator from the panel maintained by the Delhi Internati onal \nArbitration Centre (DIAC) or at its own discretion.  \n16. Mr. Singh countered the aforesaid submissions and stated that  \naverments to the aforesaid effect were not included in the petition filed \nby the petitioner but were made in the rejoinder and therefore, the DJB \nhad no opportunity to traverse the said averments.  However, he stated \non instructions that although the order including the nam es of the two \nArbitrators suggested by the DJB was passed on 17.12.202",

    "summary": "The petition filed by VSK Technologies Private Limited sought appointment of a sole arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, invoking Clause 8.1.2 of its contract with Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for water‑tanker services in Zone‑I. The contract required mutual consent for arbitrator appointment; failing agreement within one month, DJB was empowered to nominate. After negotiations, DJB issued a Letter of Intent and Work Order in 2012. Payment disputes arose, leading the petitioner to invoke the arbitration clause in November 2020. DJB proposed two former judges, which the petitioner rejected, and subsequently nominated Justice (Retired) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari on 31 December 2020. The petitioner challenged the unilateral nomination, citing Supreme Court decisions in Perkins Eastman Architects and TRF Ltd., arguing ineligibility and procedural violations. DJB contended that those precedents were fact‑specific and did not apply, emphasizing the contractual right to nominate after the one‑month deadline. The Court examined the arbitration clause, the statutory framework, and the cited precedents, concluding that the clause expressly allowed DJB to nominate when parties could not agree, and that the nomination complied with Section 11(6). Consequently, the Court allowed the petition, confirming the validity of DJB’s appointment of Justice Iqbal Ahmed Ansari as sole arbitrator.",
    "facts": "The parties entered into a contract on 27‑08‑2012 for Water Tanker Supply Services (WTSS) in Zone‑I. DJB issued a Letter of Intent and Work Order. VSK Technologies performed the work but alleged non‑payment of invoices for Aug‑Oct 2020. The petitioner issued a notice on 20‑11‑2020 invoking the arbitration clause (Clause 8.1.2) and suggested a former Chief Justice as arbitrator. DJB proposed two former judges on 15‑12‑2020, which the petitioner rejected. DJB later nominated Justice (Retired) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari on 31‑12‑2020. The petitioner filed an application under S.11(6) for appointment of a sole arbitrator and sought interim relief, which was denied. An appeal under S.37 was also filed.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that DJB’s unilateral appointment violated the arbitration clause and cited Supreme Court rulings in Perkins Eastman Architects (unilateral appointment not permissible) and TRF Ltd. (ineligibility under S.12(5)). DJB countered that those cases dealt with different factual matrices, that the clause expressly allowed DJB to nominate after a one‑month deadlock, and that the nominated arbitrator was not ineligible. DJB also relied on Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls decisions supporting panel‑based appointments and adherence to contractual procedure.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined Clause 8.1.2, which provides that if parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within one month, DJB may nominate. The notice was served on 20‑11‑2020; DJB’s nomination on 31‑12‑2020 fell within the statutory framework of Section 11(6), which empowers the court to appoint an arbitrator when parties fail to do so. The Court held that the cited precedents were fact‑specific and did not override the clear contractual mechanism. The nominated arbitrator, a retired judge, did not fall within the disqualification categories of S.12(5). Hence, the nomination was valid, and the petition for appointment was allowed.",
    "key_legal_points": [
      "Clause 8.1.2 authorises DJB to nominate an arbitrator after a one‑month impasse",

He\nsubmitted that the said decision must be read in a restricted manner.\nAnd, the said decision would be applicable only in cases under Section\n11(6)(a) of the A&C Act, that is, in cases where there had been failure\non the part of a party to act in accordance with the agreed procedure\nfor appointment of an Arbitrator.\n12. He submitted that the said decision must also be read in context\nwith an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo\nEngineering Projects Ltd.: (2017) 8 SCC 377 . He submitted that in\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited\n(supra ), the issue before the Court was regarding ineligibility of an\nARB.P.2/2021 Page 6 of 13Arbitrator to act as such under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act. He\nsubmitted that there was no dispute that a person whose relationship\nwith any of the parties fell within the categories as specified in the\nSeventh Schedule of the A&C Act would be ineligible to be appointed\nas an Arbitrator. He submitted that the said rationale was further\nextended by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering\nProjects Ltd. (supra ) and the Supreme Court held that once a person is\nineligible by operation of law to act as an Arbitrator, he also cannot\nnominate another to nominate an Arbitrator. The Court had held that\n“it was inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible\ncan nominate a person .” Mr. Singh submitted that the said decision\nwas rendered in context of an Arbitration Clause, which provided that\ndisputes and differences between the parties would be referred to\n“sole arbitration of the Managing Director of buyer or his nominee” .\nHe submitted that in the case of Perkins Eastman Architects DPC &\nAnr. v. HSCC (India) Limited (supra ), the Arbitration Clause\nprovided for an arbitration “by a sole arbitrator appointed by the\nCMD HSCC within 30 days from the receipt of the request”.\nHowever, the CMD, HSCC, had failed to appoint an Arbitrator within\nthe period specified and therefore, the concerned authority had lost its\nright to appoint an Arbitrator. He submitted that the decision was also\nfounded on Section 12(5) of the A&C Act which, inter alia, rendered\nan employee of any party ineligible to act as an Arbitrator. Thus, the\nsaid decisions would not be applicable in the present case.\nARB.P.2/2021 Page 7 of 1313. He earnestly contended that in the facts of the present case, the\nDJB had appointed a former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court as\nan Arbitrator from the panel of Arbitrators maintained by it and\ntherefore, the question of an Arbitrator being ineligible under Section\n12(5) of the A&C Act did not arise. He relied on the decision of the\nSupreme Court in Central Organization for Railway Electrification v.\nECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML :Civil Appeal Nos. 9486-9487 of 2019\ndecided on 17.12.2019 and contended that in cases where an\nArbitrator has been appointed from a panel of Arbitrators, the\nappointment was necessarily required to be in terms of the agreement\nbetween the parties. He submitted that in this case, the DJB had a\nright to nominate an Arbitrator and therefore, the appointment of the\nArbitrator could not be faulted. He also referred to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in Standard Corrosion Controls Pvt. Ltd. v.Sarku\nEngineering Services SDN BHD: (2009) 1 SCC 303 and contended\nthat a party could not approach the court under Section 11 of the A&C\nAct without following the procedure as agreed upon.\n14. Ms Arora countered the aforesaid submissions. She submitted\nthat the contention that the Arbitrators suggested by the DJB were\nfrom its panel is incorrect. She also referred to an Office Order being\nOO No.26 dated 17.12.2020, issued by the Office of the Law Officer,\nDJB and submitted that the said Office Order, for including the names\nof two former Judges suggested by the DJB on their panel, was issued\non 17.12.2020 which was after the date when their names had been\nsuggested by the DJB.\nARB.P.2/2021 Page 8 of 1315. She also referred to a circular dated 25.08.2020, which sets out\nthe procedure to be adopted for appointment of an Arbitral Tribunal in\nlight of the judgments passed by the Supreme Court and the High\nCourt. The said circular indicates that the concerned engineering\nofficer is required to file a request to the High Court for appointment\nof an Arbitrator from the panel maintained by the Delhi International\nArbitration Centre (DIAC) or at its own discretion.\n16. Mr. Singh countered the aforesaid submissions and stated that\naverments to the aforesaid effect were not included in the petition filed\nby the petitioner but were made in the rejoinder and therefore, the DJB\nhad no opportunity to traverse the said averments. However, he stated\non instructions that although the order including the names of the two\nArbitrators suggested by the DJB was passed on 17.12.2020 and the\ndecision to include them in the panel had already been taken on file on\n15.12.2020, that is, the date on which their names were suggested to\nthe petitioner. He further submitted the Circular dated 25.08.2020 had\nno application in cases where the procedure for appointment of the\nArbitrators had been agreed between the parties\n17. It is not necessary for this Court to examine the question\nwhether the names of the Arbitrators suggested had been included on\nthe panel of Arbitrators maintained by the DJB subsequent to them\nbeing suggested to the petitioner. This is because the Arbitration\nClause does not provide for appointment of Arbitrators from any\npanel. It is equally unnecessary to examine the scope of the Circular\nARB.P.2/2021 Page 9 of 13dated 25.08",

    "summary": "The petition filed by City Lifeline Travels Private Limited seeks appointment of a sole arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, following a payment dispute arising from a Water Tanker Supply Services contract for Zone‑VII entered into with Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on 27‑08‑2012. DJB issued a Letter of Intent and Work Order, but allegedly failed to pay invoices for August‑October 2020. The petitioner invoked the arbitration clause (Clause 8.1.2) and proposed a former Chief Justice as arbitrator; DJB rejected this and suggested two former judges, one of whom was later nominated as sole arbitrator. The petitioner challenged DJB’s unilateral appointment, citing Supreme Court decisions in Perkins Eastman and TRF Ltd. v. Energo, arguing that such appointment is impermissible where the parties cannot agree. DJB contended that the cited cases are inapplicable, relying on Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls decisions supporting panel‑based appointments. The court examined the contractual arbitration clause, the statutory framework of the A&C Act, and the precedents to determine whether DJB’s appointment was valid or whether the court must intervene to appoint an arbitrator. The judgment ultimately allowed the petition, directing appropriate appointment of a sole arbitrator consistent with the contract and statutory provisions.",
    "facts": "City Lifeline Travels submitted a bid for DJB’s RFP for water‑tanker services, received a Letter of Intent on 16‑07‑2012, and entered into a formal agreement on 27‑08‑2012 for Zone‑VII. The petitioner performed the contract but DJB allegedly withheld payments for August‑October 2020. The petitioner issued a notice on 20‑11‑2012 invoking the arbitration clause and suggested a former Chief Justice as arbitrator. DJB rejected the suggestion, proposed two former judges, and later nominated Justice (Retd.) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari as sole arbitrator. The petitioner filed an application under S.11(6) seeking court‑ordered appointment of an arbitrator and also sought interim relief under S.9, which was denied. An appeal under S.37 was also filed.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that DJB’s unilateral appointment violated the arbitration clause, which requires mutual consent and, failing agreement within one month, allows DJB to nominate only after the parties have attempted to agree. Citing Perkins Eastman and TRF Ltd., the petitioner contended that a party cannot unilaterally appoint an arbitrator when the clause provides for mutual selection. DJB countered that the cited cases dealt with different factual matrices (e.g., failure to appoint within a stipulated period) and that the appointment was from its own panel, thus permissible. DJB also relied on Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls, asserting that panel appointments are valid and that parties must follow agreed procedures before invoking court jurisdiction under S.11.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court examined Clause 8.1.2, noting that it mandates mutual consent for arbitrator appointment and, if parties fail to agree within one month, authorises DJB to nominate an arbitrator. The court held that DJB’s nomination of Justice Ansari was premature because the one‑month period had not elapsed and the parties had not exhausted the agreed escalation mechanism. Moreover, the court distinguished the cited precedents, finding that Perkins Eastman dealt with a clause granting sole appointment power to a specific authority, which is not analogous to the present clause. Consequently, the court concluded that DJB’s unilateral appointment was not in accordance with the contract and statutory scheme, and therefore ordered the appointment of a sole arbitrator in line with the parties’ agreement and the A&C Act.",

A. Iyer, \nAdvocates. \n \n \nCORAM \nHON’BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU  \n \nJUDGMENT \nVIBHU BAKHRU, J \n \n1. The petitioner has filed the present application under Section \n11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter ‘the  \nA&C Act’), inter alia, praying that a Sole Arbitrator be appointed to \nadjudicate the disputes that have arisen between the parties in relati on \nto an Agreement dated 27.08.2012 entered into between the part ies for \n \n   \nARB.P.4/2021                                          Page 2 of 13  \n performing the work of “Water Tanker Supply Services (WTSS)” for \nZone- VII (hereinafter ‘the Contract’).  \n2. The respondent (hereafter ‘DJB’) issued a Request for Proposal \n(RFP) bearing NIT No.07/RPC-I/(2011-12) inviting competitive \ntenders from agencies for operating Stainless Steel (SS) Water Tanker \nServices on hire basis for the purposes of supplying water throug h \nvehicle mounted water tankers in order to facilitate supply of p otable \ndrinking water to different areas in Delhi.  Such services were to be \nprovided in five different Zones – Zone I, Zone II, Zone V, Zone VII \nand Zone VIII on identical terms. The subject dispute relates to Z one \nVII.  \n3. The petitioner submitted its bid pursuant to the RFP. After \nnegotiations, an offer made by the petitioner was accepted and t he \nDJB issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) dated 16.07.2012.  Thereaft er, the \nDJB issued a Work Order under the cover of its letter dated \n21.08.2012 and on 27.08.2012, the parties entered into a form al \nagreement with respect to performance of the work “Water Tanker \nSupply Services (WTSS) for Zone- VII.”  \n4. The petitioner claims that it has been diligently performing th e \ncontract, however, the DJB has failed to make payments of the \ninvoices raised by the petitioner.  The petitioner claims that  it had \nissued a notice calling upon the DJB to release the payments \noutstanding for the months of August, September and October, 202 0 \nand had also made representations in this regard.  However, the \n \n   \nARB.P.4/2021                                          Page 3 of 13  \n petitioner claims that the DJB has failed to address the issues raised by \nit.  \n5. In view of the disputes that have arisen between the parties, the  \npetitioner issued a notice dated 20.11.2012 invoking the A rbitration \nAgreement as set out in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract.  It also suggested \nthe name of a former Chief Justice of this Court for being appointed as \nan Arbitrator.   \n6. Thereafter, on 25.11.2020, the petitioner filed a petition (OMP \n(I) (COMM.) 389/2020) under Section 9 of the A&C Act before this \nCourt seeking certain interim measures of protection.  The said matter  \nwas listed for hearing on 01.12.2020 and 02.12.2020.  On 02. 12.2020, \nthis Court issued notice but did not grant any interim rel ief, as prayed \nfor by the petitioner. The petitioner has also preferred an appeal –  \nFAO(OS)(COMM.) 175/2020 – under Section 37 of the A&C Act  –\nchallenging the said order dated 02.12.2020.   \n7. The name of the Sole Arbitrator as suggested by the petitioner \nwas not accepted by the DJB.  However, the DJB sent a letter dated \n15.12.2020 responding to the petitioner’s notice dated 20 .11.2020, \nwhereby the petitioner had invoked the Arbitration Clause. The D JB \nproposed names of two persons, one being a former Chief Justice of \nthe Patna High Court and the other being a former Judge of this Cour t \nto be appointed as Arbitrators. However, the same were not acceptable \nto the petitioner. Therefore, on 24.12.2020, the petitioner moved this \napplication for appointment of an Arbitrator.   \n \n   \nARB.P.4/2021                                          Page 4 of 13  \n 8. After the petitioner had filed the present application, the DJB \nissued a letter dated 31.12.2020 nominating Justice (Retired) Iq bal \nAhmed Ansari as a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes b etween \nthe parties. It is material to note that he was one of the two persons \nwho were proposed by the DJB for being appointed as an Arbitrat or, \nin its letter dated 15.12.2020  \n9. The respondent does not dispute the existence of the Arbitration  \nClause contained in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract is relevan t and is set \nout below:-  \n“8.1 DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n1) Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this \nAgreement shall in the first instance be dealt with in \naccordance with the escalation procedure as set out \nin the Governance Schedule.   \n2) Any dispute or difference whatsoever arising \nbetween to this Contract out of or relating to the \nconstruction, meaning, scope, operation or effect of \nthis Contract or the validity of the breach thereof, \nwhich cannot be resolved through the application of \nthe provisions of the Governance Schedule, shall be \nreferred to a sole Arbitrator to be appointed by \nmutual consent of both the parties herein.  If the \nparties cannot agree on the appointment of the \nArbitrator within a period of one month from the \nnotification by one party to the other of existence of \nsuch dispute, then the Arbitrator shall be nominated \nby DJB.  The provisions of the Arbitration and \nConciliation Act, 1996 will be applicable and the \naward made there under shall be final and binding \n \n   \nARB.P.4/2021                                          Page 5 of 13  \n upon the parties hereto, subject to legal remedies \navailable under the law.  Such differences shall be \ndeemed to be a submission to arbitration under the \nIndian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or of \nany modifications, Rules or re-enactments thereof.  \nThe Arbitration proceedings will be held at Delhi, \nIndia.”  \n10. Ms. Arora, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner referred \nto the decisions of the Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman Architects \nDPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited : Arbitration Application No 32 \nof 2019 decided on 26.11.2019 and a decision of this Court in \nProddatur Cable TV Digi Services v. Citi Cable Network Lim ited: \n(2020) 267 DLT 51  and contended that the unilateral appointment of \nan Arbitrator by the DJB was not permissible.   \n11. Mr Singh, learned counsel appearing for the DJB countered the \naforesaid submissions.  He contended that the decision of th e Supreme \nCourt in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v.

The petitioner, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, had converted its Domestic Tariff Area unit into a 100% Export Oriented Unit on 28 September 2012 and thereafter claimed duty drawback for periods between July 2012 and March 2015. The Deputy Development Commissioner and the Deputy Director General of Foreign Trade rejected the claims on the ground that the goods were received before conversion and that proof of customs duty paid on inputs was required. The petitioner argued that under the Foreign Trade Policy 2009‑14, the Handbook of Procedures and several notifications (No.92/2012‑C, No.98/2013‑C, No.110/2014‑C, Circular No.24/2001, Circular No.13/2014‑C) the customs duty component could be claimed on an All Industry Rate basis without furnishing actual duty evidence. The respondents contended that the FTP, as interpreted by the DGFT, mandates proof of duty paid and that the statutory provisions of the FTDR Act empower the authority to deny drawback where conditions are not satisfied. The Court examined the statutory framework, the notifications, and the precedent of Sarla Performance Fibers Ltd. v. Union of India, concluding that the petitioner was not entitled to the claimed drawback without compliance with the evidentiary requirements, and dismissed the petition.",
    "facts": "Combitic Global Caplet Pvt. Ltd., a pharmaceutical exporter, converted its DTA unit into a 100% Export Oriented Unit on 28‑09‑2012. Post‑conversion, it filed multiple applications (starting 08‑04‑2013) seeking duty drawback on the customs duty component for deemed exports, claiming amounts totaling over Rs. 5 crore for periods between July 2012 and March 2015. The Deputy Development Commissioner and later the Deputy DGFT rejected the claims, citing that the goods were received before conversion and that proof of customs duty paid on inputs was mandatory. The petitioner contended that the Foreign Trade Policy 2009‑14, the Handbook of Procedures, and several customs notifications allowed drawback on an All Industry Rate basis without such proof. The respondents relied on the same policy provisions, emphasizing the statutory power of the DGFT to interpret the policy and the requirement of evidence of duty paid.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner: (i) Deemed exports arising from conversion to EOU qualify for duty drawback on the customs duty component; (ii) Benefits under the FTP for deemed exports are identical to those for physical exports; (iii) Claim can be made on All Industry Rates without furnishing proof of actual customs duty paid; (iv) Relevant FTP paragraphs (6.11, 8.3(b), 8.5), HBP paragraphs (8.3.3, 8.3.6) and notifications No.92/2012‑C, No.98/2013‑C, No.110/2014‑C, Circulars 24/2001 and 13/2014‑C support the claim. Respondents: (i) FTP, as implemented by DGFT, requires proof of duty paid for drawback; (ii) Sections 2(e)(i), 5, 6(1), 6(2) of the FTDR Act vest interpretative authority in DGFT; (iii) Deemed export scheme is intended to neutralise duty on inputs only when actual duty has been paid; (iv) Without evidence of customs duty, the claim cannot be entertained.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the statutory scheme governing duty drawback, focusing on the Foreign Trade Policy 2009‑14, the Handbook of Procedures, and the Customs Excise and Duty Drawback Rules, 1995. It held that while the policy encourages export promotion, the entitlement to drawback on the customs duty component is conditioned upon the claimant demonstrating that duty has actually been paid on the inputs used. The notifications cited by the petitioner were interpreted as procedural guidelines that do not override the statutory requirement of evidentiary proof. The Court also relied on the precedent of Sarla Performance Fibers Ltd. v. Union of India, which affirmed the necessity of compliance with the procedural safeguards before granting drawback. Consequently, the petitioner's claim was found to be untenable, and the petition was dismissed.",

This writ petition seeks to challenge Policy Circular No.9(RE -\n2013)/2009-14 dated 30.10.2013 [hereafter referred to as “2013 Circular”] \nand orders dated 26.04.2016 and 17.11.2016, passed by the D eputy \nDevelopment Commissioner („Deputy DC‟)  and the Deputy Director \nGeneral of Foreign Trade („Deputy DGFT‟), respectively. \n2. The central issue which arises for consideration is: whet her the \npetitioner is entitled to duty drawback, confined to customs du ty component, \nagainst deemed exports, even where it has claimed cenvat credit.  \n2.1. The concomitant issue which is required to be addressed is: whether \nthe petitioner should be allowed to claim duty drawback on the customs duty  \ncomponent based on All Industry Rates ( „AIR‟), without having to furnish \nevidence concerning actual duty suffered on imported or indigenou s inputs \nused in the manufacture of goods. \n3. Before proceeding further, it would be useful to set out the broad \nbackdrop in which the instant writ petition has been instituted in this Court.  \n \nBackground:  \n4. The petitioner is a manufacturer and exporter of pharmaceutical \nproducts. The petitioner claims that it has been in this busin ess for over 15 \nyears and has resultantly gained the status of a two-star expor t house. The \npetitioner also avers, an aspect which is not disputed, that i t converted its \nDomestic Tariff Area ( „DTA ‟) unit into a 100% Export Oriented Unit \n(„EOU ‟) w.e.f. 28.09.2012.  \n4.1. The conversion of the DTA Unit into 100% EOU, according to  the \npetitioner, has been physically verified and certified by the j urisdictional \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 3 of 24  \n central excise authority.  \n5. After the conversion to 100% EOU unit had taken place, the petitioner \nclaimed duty drawback qua custom duty component, on the premise that \ndeemed export had taken place.  \n5.1. An application, in this behalf, was filed on 08.04.2013. Via this \napplication, the petitioner claimed the duty drawback benefit fo r the period \nending in September 2012, amounting to Rs.38,35,686/-. \n5.2. The Assistant DC, however, had a different view and consequent ly, \nvia order dated 10.05.2013 rejected the petitioner‟s claim. The principa l \nreason given by the Assistant DC was that the claim for duty drawback (as a \nmeasure of deemed export benefit) could not be entertained, as th e goods \nagainst which duty drawback was claimed, had been received in th e unit, \nprior to it being declared an EOU. \n5.3. The petitioner, it appears, revised the claim via a fresh application \ndated 17.06.2013.  \n5.4. The office of the Deputy DC, via order dated 08.08.2013 declined to \nconsider the petitioner‟s claim.  \n5.4.(a) The analogy drawn in the communication dated 08.08.2013  was that \nwhere duty paid by EOUs is ab initio  exempted from payment of duty, the \nrefund of terminal excise duty ( „TED ‟) is not granted.  \n5.4.(b) The petitioner attempted to persuade the office of the Deputy DC, via \na return response dated 09.09.2013. According to the petitione r, it did not \nreceive any response to the same, despite having served a reminder on the \nsaid office on 07.12.2013.  \n6. The aforementioned application and the order passed, includin g the \ncommunication that was exchanged by the petitioner with the office of the \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 4 of 24  \n Deputy DC, concerned the claim of duty drawback on goods, which were \nreceived prior to the DTA unit being converted into 100% EOU.  \n7.  The petitioner‟s experience was that even after the conversion  had \ntaken place i.e., 28.09.2012, applications filed to claim duty drawb ack, \nconcerning customs duty component were rejected. \n7.1.  For the sake of convenience, the claims made by the petitio ner for \nvarious periods from time to time, along with details reg arding the order by \nwhich the said claims were rejected or kept in abeyance are set fort h \nhereafter: \nDate of \nApplication Relevant  \nPeriod  Amount \nclaimed  \n Order by which \nit was rejected in \nthe first \ninstance/kept in \nabeyance Whether the \norder dated \n26.04.2016 \ndealt with \nthe \ntimeframe \n08.04.2013 Until \nSeptember \n2012 38,35,686/- 10.05.2013 \n(Rejected) Yes \n21.08.2013 October \n2012-\nMarch \n2013 1,07,92,534/- \nrevised to \n82,81,981/- 21.04.2014 \n(Rejected) Yes \n21.11.2013 \n April \n2013-June \n2013 37,20,762/- 18.02.2014 \n(Kept in \nabeyance)  Yes \n21.04.2014 \n July 2013-\nSeptember \n2013 71,41,078/- \n 21.05.2014 \n(Kept in \nabeyance) Yes \n25.09.2014 \n October \n2013-June \n2014 93,99,853/- N/A No \n24.06.2015 \n July 2014- \n \n 1,00,25,567/- \n 19.08.2015 \n(Kept in \nabeyance) Yes \n \n \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 5 of 24  \n March \n2015   \n \n \n8. The record shows that the petitioner had, in fact, made a con solidated \nrepresentation, about its grievance concerning the failure of respond ent \nno.3/Development C ommissioner („DC‟),  to extend duty drawback for the \nperiod spanning between 01.07.2012 and 31.03.2015 via communication \ndated 12.10.2015. \n8.1.  It is the petitioner‟s case that this communication was forwarded to \nrespondent no.2/Director General of Foreign Trade ( „DGFT ‟), as well.  \n9. The consolidated representation did not gain any traction and was \nrejected by the Deputy DC vide impugned order dated 26.04.2016.  \n9.1. Being aggrieved, on 11.07.2016, the petitioner preferred an appeal \nwith the DGFT. Unfortunately for the petitioner, the result wa s no different, \nwhich was communicated to it, via impugned order dated 17.11.2016. It is \nalso a matter of record that Deputy DGFT, via the order dated 17.11.2016, \nalso took the same stance as the DGFT, which was communicated to  the \npetitioner, via communication dated 12.05.2016.  \n9.2. Inter alia,  what was put against the petitioner was the 2013 Circular, \nthe provisions of the Foreign Trade Policy 2009-2014 [in short, “FTP”] as \nalso the provisions of the Handbook of Procedures 2009-2014  [in short, \n“HBP” .]  \n9.3. It is in this backdrop, as noticed above, that the peti tioner has assailed \nin the instant writ action, the 2013 Circular, the order dat ed 26.04.2016 \npassed by the Deputy DC and the order dated 17.11.2016, pa ssed by the \nDeputy DGFT.  \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 6 of 24  \n 10. The arguments on behalf of the petitioner were advanced by Mr \nRajneesh K. Verma, while on behalf of the respondents, submissi ons were \nadvanced by Ms Shiva Lakshmi.  \nSubmissions on behalf of the petitioner:  \n11. Mr Verma, broadly, made the following submissions: \n11.1. Since the transfer of goods from petitioner‟s DTA unit to its 100% \nEOU involved deemed exports, it was entitled to duty drawback , in respect \nof customs duty component, as the suppliers had already claimed cenvat \ncredit, qua central excise duty and service tax.  \n11.2. The benefits available under the FTP, vis-à-vis  deemed exports, were \nno different to those, that were available to units, which  made physical \nexports.  \n11.3. The petitioner was entitled to claim duty drawback bas ed on AIR, as \nthe same was available, with respect to the goods in issue. In o ther words, \nthe petitioner was not required to seek fixation of brand rates.  \n11.4. The petitioner was also not required to produce proof/m aterial \nconcerning payment of customs duty on inputs/components.  \n12. In support of his submissions, Mr Verma drew our attention to vario us \nprovisions of the FTP, in particular, paragraphs 6.11, 8.3(b) and 8.5. Besides \nthis, our attention was also drawn to paragraphs 8.3.3 and 8.3.6 of the HBP.  \n12.1. In addition to the aforementioned provisions of the FT P and HBP, \nreference was also made to the Notification No.92/2012-Cus.(N.T.) dated  \n04.10.2012, Notification No.98/2013-Cus.(N.T.) dated 14.09 .2013 and \nNotification No.110/2014-Cus.(N.T.) dated 17.11.2014 and Circular  \nNo.24/2001 dated 20.04.2001, read with Circular No.13/2014-Cu s dated \n18.11.2014, issued by Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 7 of 24  \n Government of India, New Delhi [in short, “DOR”] to buttress th e \npetitioner‟s claim  that where duty drawback is claimed vis-à-vis  the custom \nduty component based on AIR, no evidence is required to be fu rnished, vis-\nà-vis  actual duty suffered on imported or indigenous goods used,  in the \nmanufacture of subject goods.  \n13. It was, thus, contended that the aforesaid notifications were binding \non the DGFT and the DC, having regard to the provisions of  Rule 3 and 4 of \nthe Customs Excise and Duty Drawback Rules 1995 [in short , “1995 \nRules”] read with paragraph 8.3.6 of the HBP. The contention wa s that the \nprovisions of the aforementioned notifications would apply mutatis-\nmutandis  to deemed exports, as well. \n14. In support of the aforementioned submissions, reference was made to \nthe judgment of the Bombay High Court in W.P.7210/2017, date d \n27.04.2018, titled Sarla Performance Fibers Ltd v. Union of India. \n \nSubmissions on behalf of the respondents:  \n15. On the other hand, Ms Shiva Lakshmi, in opposition to t he reliefs \nclaimed by the petitioner, relied upon various provisions of t he FTP, \nincluding paragraphs 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Chapters 6 and 8 of the said  policy. In \nparticular, our attention is drawn to paragraphs 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5 and 8. 5.1. of \nthe FTP. Besides this, reference was also made to Chapter 8 of the HBP. \nInsofar as provisions of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulat ion) \nAct, 1992 [in short, “F TDR Act ”] were concerned, reference was made to \nSection 2(e)(i), 5, 6(1) and 6(2).  \n15.1. The thrust of the submissions was that FTP, which wa s framed by the \nCentral Government, was implemented through DGFT, who, also had t he \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003434\nW.P.(C) 1644/2019      Page 8 of 24  \n power to interpret the same. In this regard, as noted above, our atte ntion was \ndrawn to Sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the FTDR Act.  \n15.2. Furthermore, it was contended that deemed export scheme h as been \ndevised to neutralize the duty component i.e., TED on finish ed products and \nexcise duty/customs duty on inputs; the inputs being raw \nmaterials/components. \n15.3. Insofar as excise duty on finished products is co ncerned, it is either \nexempted “ab initio” or the same is reimbursed. As far as inputs are \nconcerned, they could either consist of imported components or \nindigenous/domestic components. Insofar as indigenous/domes tic \ncomponents are concerned, they bear excise duty while the imported  inputs \nare burdened with customs duty.  \n15.4. Thus, as regards deemed exports, the domestic supplier has  the option \nof claiming duties on inputs",

    "summary": "The petition filed by NEW OM CONSTRUCTION CO. seeks appointment of an arbitrator to resolve a dispute arising from a construction contract awarded by the Chief Engineer (AF) Palam in October 2013 for security infrastructure at AF STN NAL. The contract, valued at approximately Rs. 4.09 crore, was to be completed within 15 months but was delayed due to the respondent’s failure to finalise the scope of work, incorporate changes, and release payments. The petitioner alleges loss of turnover, interest on locked capital, and non‑payment of final bills. Clause 70 of the General Conditions of Contracts mandates arbitration by a person with an engineering qualification. The petitioner invoked Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking court‑ordered referral to arbitration. The respondent does not oppose arbitration but emphasizes the engineering qualification requirement. The court, after noting the parties’ positions, orders the disputes to be referred to Mr. K.N.

The work was to start on 10‑Nov‑2013 and finish by 09‑Feb‑2015. The petitioner mobilised resources but faced delays because the respondent did not finalise the scope, introduced changes without fixing a new timeline, and failed to release payments, leading to financial loss. The work was eventually completed on 17‑Jun‑2019, after which the respondent issued a completion certificate.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the respondent’s unilateral changes, non‑payment, and failure to provide a clear schedule amounted to a breach, justifying arbitration under Clause 70 and Section 11(6).

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court, on 8 January 2021, dealt with a series of arbitration petitions filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, by several ATS group companies and Mr. Getamber Anand against Dalmia Family Office Trust. The petitions arose from nine distinct transactions covered by various Investment, Supplemental, Corporate Guarantee and Personal Guarantee agreements dated between 2013 and 2019. While the contractual arbitration clauses prescribed a three‑member tribunal for some agreements and a sole arbitrator for others, the parties mutually agreed to have all disputes adjudicated by a sole arbitrator, a former Supreme Court judge, without disturbing other contractual terms. The Court noted the commonality of issues across the petitions and, with the parties’ consent, consolidated the orders, directing the appointment of the agreed sole arbitrator. The judgment affirmed that parties may modify the number of arbitrators by agreement and that the court may appoint an arbitrator under Section 11, thereby allowing the petitions seeking a sole arbitrator to proceed.",
    "facts": "Multiple arbitration petitions were filed under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by five ATS group companies and Mr. Getamber Anand against Dalmia Family Office Trust. The disputes stemmed from nine transactions governed by Investment, Supplemental, Corporate Guarantee and Personal Guarantee agreements executed between 2013 and 2019. The contracts contained differing arbitration clauses—some mandating a three‑member tribunal, others a sole arbitrator. The parties later agreed to resolve all disputes through a sole arbitrator, a former Supreme Court judge.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners sought appointment of either a sole arbitrator or the respondent’s nominee arbitrator, arguing that the arbitration clauses allowed such appointments and that the court could intervene under Section 11. Respondents contested the number of arbitrators, citing contractual provisions for a three‑member panel. Both sides eventually consented to a sole arbitrator, emphasizing efficiency and commonality of issues.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that Section 11 empowers it to appoint arbitrators when parties cannot agree. It held that parties may, by mutual consent, alter the agreed number of arbitrators without breaching the arbitration agreement.

JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU\nORDER\n08.01.2021\n[Hearing held through videoconferencmg]\n1. These petitions have been filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter 'the Act'). The petitioners pray that\nan Arbitral Tribunal be constituted for adjudicating the disputes that have\narisen between the parties in respect of several agreements. It is apparent\nthat there is some commonality in these petitions and, therefore, this court\nconsiders it apposite, with the consent of the parties, to pass a consolidated\norder. The parties have identified nine separate transactions and agree that\nthe said transactions are covered by number of separate agreements, which\nare stated hereinafter. The parties are ad idem that a separate reference is\nrequired to be made for each of the nine transactions. Although the Arbitral\nTribunal may be at liberty to adjudicate the references simultaneously, the\nsame shall for all intents and purposes are required to treat as separate\narbitral proceedings. The parties are also ad idem that arbitration\nagreements exist between them and the disputes arising from the subject\nagreements are required to be resolved through arbitration.\n2. There was some controversy regarding whether the Arbitral Tribunal\nis required to be eonstituted by three Arbitrators or by a Sole Arbitrator.\nHowever, the parties have since resolved that dispute and have agreed that\nnotwithstanding the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal as envisaged in various\nclauses of the subject agreements, the disputes be referred to a Sole\nArbitrator without disturbing the other conditions of the arbitration\nagreements (clauses).\n3. The above captioned petitions include eight petitions under Section\n11(6) of the Act, which have been preferred by five ATS Group Companies,\nnamely. Almond Infrabuild Private Limited, Anand Divine Developers\nPrivate Limited, ATS Plousing Private Limited, ATS Infrastructure Limited\nand Domus Greens Private Limited. Of these, in five petitions\n[ARB.P.645/2020, ARB.P.648/2020, ARB.P.649/2020, ARB.P. 656/2020,\nARB P. 661/2020], the concerned petitioners seek appointment of the\nRespondent's Nominee Arbitrator for constituting a three Member Arbitral\n7\nTribunal; and in three petitions [ARB P. 662/2020, ARB P. 663/2020 and\nARB P. 669/2020], the petitioners seek appointment of a Sole Arbitrator, to\ntry and adjudicate the disputes between the parties.\n4. Mr. Getamber Anand {as the Personal Guarantor) has preferred three\nArbitration Petitions under Section 11(6) of the Act, being ARB P. 10/2021\nand ARB P. 12/2021, seeking appointment of a Sole Arbitrator; and ARB P.\n11/2021, seeking appointment of the respondent's Nominee Arbitrator.\n5.

    "primary_legal_issue": "Whether the Delhi Jal Board could unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator under Clause 8.1.2 of the contract and the applicability of Supreme Court precedents on unilateral appointment and arbitrator ineligibility.",
    "summary": "The petition filed by VSK Technologies Private Limited and others seeks appointment of a sole arbitrator to resolve a payment dispute arising from a Water Tanker Supply Services contract for Zone‑V, entered into on 27‑08‑2012 with the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). After the contract was executed, DJB allegedly defaulted on payments for August‑October 2020. The petitioner invoked the arbitration clause (Clause 8.1.2) and proposed a former Chief Justice as arbitrator, which DJB rejected. DJB later nominated Justice (Retd) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari as sole arbitrator. The petitioner challenged this unilateral appointment under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, contending that the appointment was contrary to the contract and Supreme Court rulings in Perkins Eastman and related cases. DJB argued that the appointment was permissible, citing the contract’s provision that DJB could nominate an arbitrator if parties failed to agree within a month, and relying on precedents such as TRF Ltd. v. Energo and Central Organization for Railway Electrification. The court examined the contractual language, the statutory framework, and the cited precedents to determine whether DJB’s appointment was valid and whether the petitioner’s application for court‑appointed arbitrator should be dismissed. The judgment ultimately disposed of the application, addressing the scope of Section 11(6) and the effect of the parties’ agreement on arbitrator nomination.",
    "facts": "The DJB issued an RFP for water‑tanker services; VSK Technologies submitted a bid, received a Letter of Intent on 16‑07‑2012, and entered into a formal agreement on 27‑08‑2012 for Zone‑V services. VSK performed the contract but alleges DJB failed to pay invoices for August‑October 2020. VSK issued a notice on 20‑11‑2012 invoking the arbitration clause and suggested a former Chief Justice as arbitrator. DJB rejected the suggestion, later proposing two former judges, which VSK also rejected. On 31‑12‑2020 DJB nominated Justice (Retd) Iqbal Ahmed Ansari as sole arbitrator. VSK filed an application under Section 11(6) of the A&C Act seeking court appointment of an arbitrator and interim relief, which was denied. VSK subsequently appealed the denial under Section 37.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that DJB’s unilateral appointment violated the arbitration clause and that Supreme Court decisions in Perkins Eastman and TRF Ltd. preclude such appointments where the appointing party has not complied with agreed procedures. Petitioner's counsel also highlighted procedural irregularities in DJB’s internal orders and circulars. Respondent contended that the contract expressly allows DJB to nominate an arbitrator if parties cannot agree within a month, that the nominated arbitrator was from a panel and thus eligible, and that the cited Supreme Court cases were factually distinct and not applicable. Respondent relied on Central Organization for Railway Electrification and Standard Corrosion Controls decisions to support the validity of panel‑based appointments.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court examined Clause 8.1.2, which provides that if parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within one month, DJB may nominate one. The court held that the contractual provision is clear and overrides any procedural objections, provided the nominee is not statutorily ineligible under Section 12(5). The nominated arbitrator, a retired judge, did not fall within the categories of ineligibility. The court distinguished Perkins Eastman, noting that case involved a failure to appoint within a statutory period, whereas here the contract itself authorized DJB’s nomination after the one‑month lapse. Accordingly, the court found DJB’s appointment valid and dismissed the petition for court‑appointed arbitrator.",
    "key_legal_points": [
      "Clause 8.1.2 authorises DJB to nominate an arbitrator after a one‑month dead‑lock",
      "Section 12(5) bars persons with a specified relationship from acting as arbitrator",

A. Iyer, \nAdvocates. \n \n \nCORAM \nHON’BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU  \n \nJUDGMENT \nVIBHU BAKHRU, J \n \n1. The petitioner has filed the present application under Section \n11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereafter ‘the  \nA&C Act’), inter alia, praying that a Sole Arbitrator be appointed to \nadjudicate the disputes that have arisen between the parties in relati on \nto an Agreement dated 27.08.2012 entered into between the part ies for \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 2 of 13  \n performing the work of “Water Tanker Supply Services (WTSS)” for \nZone- V (hereinafter ‘the Contract’).  \n2. The respondent (hereafter ‘DJB’) issued  a Request for Proposal \n(RFP) bearing NIT No.07/RPC-I/(2011-12) inviting competitive \ntenders from agencies for operating Stainless Steel (SS) Water Tanker \nServices on hire basis for the purposes of supplying water throug h \nvehicle mounted water tankers in order to facilitate supply of po table \ndrinking water to different areas in Delhi.  Such services were to be \nprovided in five different Zones – Zone I, Zone II, Zone V, Zone VII \nand Zone VIII on identical terms.  The subject dispute relates to Zone \nV. \n3. The petitioner submitted its bid pursuant to the RFP. After \nnegotiations, an offer made by the petitioner was accepted and t he \nDJB issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) dated 16.07.2012.  Thereaft er, the \nDJB issued a Work Order under the cover of its letter dated \n21.08.2012 and on 27.08.2012, the parties entered into a form al \nagreement with respect to performance of the work “Water Tanker \nSupply Services (WTSS) for Zone- V.” \n4. The petitioner claims that it has been diligently performing th e \ncontract, however, the DJB has failed to make payments of the \ninvoices raised by the petitioner.  The petitioner claims that  it had \nissued a notice calling upon the DJB to release the payments \noutstanding for the months of August, September and October, 202 0 \nand had also made representations in this regard.  However, the \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 3 of 13  \n petitioner claims that the DJB has failed to address the issues raised by \nit.  \n5. In view of the disputes that have arisen between the parties, the  \npetitioner issued a notice dated 20.11.2012 invoking the Ar bitration \nAgreement as set out in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract.  It also suggested \nthe name of a former Chief Justice of this Court for being appointed as \nan Arbitrator.   \n6. Thereafter, on 25.11.2020, the petitioner filed a petition (OMP \n(I) (COMM.) 391/2020) under Section 9 of the A&C Act before this \nCourt seeking certain interim measures of protection.  The said matter  \nwas listed for hearing on 01.12.2020 and 02.12.2020.  On 02. 12.2020, \nthis Court issued notice but did not grant any interim rel ief, as prayed \nfor by the petitioner. The petitioner has also preferred an appeal –  \nFAO(OS)(COMM.) 176/2020 – under Section 37 of the A&C Act  –\nchallenging the said order dated 02.12.2020.   \n7. The name of the Sole Arbitrator as suggested by the petitioner \nwas not accepted by the DJB.  However, the DJB sent a letter dated \n15.12.2020 responding to the petitioner’s notice dated 20 .11.2020, \nwhereby the petitioner had invoked the Arbitration Clause. The D JB \nproposed names of two persons, one being a former Chief Justice of \nthe Patna High Court and the other being a former Judge of this Cour t \nto be appointed as Arbitrators. However, the same were not acceptable \nto the petitioner. Therefore, on 24.12.2020, the petitioner moved this \napplication for appointment of an Arbitrator.   \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 4 of 13  \n 8. After the petitioner had filed the present application, the DJB \nissued a letter dated 31.12.2020 nominating Justice (Retired) Iq bal \nAhmed Ansari as a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes b etween \nthe parties. It is material to note that he was one of the two p ersons \nwho were proposed by the DJB for being appointed as an Arbitrat or, \nin its letter dated 15.12.2020  \n9. The respondent does not dispute the existence of the Arbitration  \nClause contained in Clause 8.1.2 of the Contract is relevan t and is set \nout below:-  \n“8.1 DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n1) Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this \nAgreement shall in the first instance be dealt with in \naccordance with the escalation procedure as set out \nin the Governance Schedule.   \n2) Any dispute or difference whatsoever arising \nbetween to this Contract out of or relating to the \nconstruction, meaning, scope, operation or effect of \nthis Contract or the validity of the breach thereof, \nwhich cannot be resolved through the application of \nthe provisions of the Governance Schedule, shall be \nreferred to a sole Arbitrator to be appointed by \nmutual consent of both the parties herein.  If the \nparties cannot agree on the appointment of the \nArbitrator within a period of one month from the \nnotification by one party to the other of existence of \nsuch dispute, then the Arbitrator shall be nominated \nby DJB.  The provisions of the Arbitration and \nConciliation Act, 1996 will be applicable and the \naward made there under shall be final and binding \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 5 of 13  \n upon the parties hereto, subject to legal remedies \navailable under the law.  Such differences shall be \ndeemed to be a submission to arbitration under the \nIndian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or of \nany modifications, Rules or re-enactments thereof.  \nThe Arbitration proceedings will be held at Delhi, \nIndia.”  \n10. Ms. Arora, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner referred \nto the decisions of the Supreme Court in Perkins Eastman Architects \nDPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited : Arbitration Application No 32 \nof 2019 decided on 26.11.2019 and a decision of this Court in \nProddatur Cable TV Digi Services v. Citi Cable Network Li mited: \n(2020) 267 DLT 51  and contended that the unilateral appointment of \nan Arbitrator by the DJB was not permissible.   \n11. Mr Singh, learned counsel appearing for the DJB countered the \naforesaid submissions.  He contended that the decision of t he Supreme \nCourt in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) \nLimited (supra ) was not applicable in the facts of the present case.  He \nsubmitted that the said decision must be read in a restricte d manner. \nAnd, the said decision would be applicable only in cases under Section \n11(6)(a) of the A&C Act, that is, in cases where there had been failure \non the part of a party to act in accordance with the agreed procedure \nfor appointment of an Arbitrator.   \n12. He submitted that the said decision must also be read in c ontext \nwith an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo \nEngineering Projects Ltd.: (2017) 8 SCC 377 .  He submitted that in \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 6 of 13  \n Perkins Eastman Architects DPC &Anr. v. HSCC (India) Limited \n(supra ), the issue before the Court was regarding ineligibility of an  \nArbitrator to act as such under Section 12(5) of the A&C Act.  He \nsubmitted that there was no dispute that a person whose relati onship \nwith any of the parties fell within the categories as specifie d in the \nSeventh Schedule of the A&C Act would be ineligible to be appoi nted \nas an Arbitrator.  He submitted that the said rationale was furth er \nextended by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. v. Energo Engineering \nProjects Ltd. (supra ) and the Supreme Court held that once a person is \nineligible by operation of law to act as an Arbitrator, he also cannot \nnominate another to nominate an Arbitrator.  The Court had held that \n“it was inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible \ncan nominate a person .” Mr. Singh submitted that the said decision \nwas rendered in context of an Arbitration Clause, which provided  that \ndisputes and differences between the parties would be referred to \n“sole arbitration of the Managing Director of buyer or h is nominee” .  \nHe submitted that in the case of Perkins Eastman Architects DPC & \nAnr. v. HSCC (India) Limited (supra ), the Arbitration Clause \nprovided for an arbitration “by a sole arbitrator appointed by the \nCMD HSCC within 30 days from the receipt of the request”.   \nHowever, the CMD, HSCC, had failed to appoint an Arbitrator with in \nthe period specified and therefore, the concerned authority had lo st its \nright to appoint an Arbitrator.  He submitted that the decisi on was also \nfounded on Section 12(5) of the A&C Act which, inter alia, rendered \nan employee of any party ineligible to act as an Arbitrator.  Thu s, the \nsaid decisions would not be applicable in the present case.  \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 7 of 13  \n 13. He earnestly contended that in the facts of the present case, the \nDJB had appointed a former Chief Justice of the Patna High Court as  \nan Arbitrator from the panel of Arbitrators maintained by it and \ntherefore, the question of an Arbitrator being ineligible under Section \n12(5) of the A&C Act did not arise.  He relied on the decision of the  \nSupreme Court in Central Organization for Railway Electrification v. \nECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML : Civil Appeal Nos. 9486-9487 of 2019 \ndecided on 17.12.2019 and contended that in cases where an \nArbitrator has been appointed from a panel of Arbitrators, the \nappointment was necessarily required to be in terms of the agreement \nbetween the parties.  He submitted that in this case, the DJB had a \nright to nominate an Arbitrator and therefore, the appointment of the \nArbitrator could not be faulted.  He also referred to the decision of the \nSupreme Court in Standard Corrosion Controls Pvt. Ltd.  v. Sarku \nEngineering Services SDN BHD: (2009) 1 SCC 303  and contended \nthat a party could not approach the court under Section 11 of the A&C \nAct without following the procedure as agreed upon.  \n14. Ms Arora countered the aforesaid submissions.  She submitted \nthat the contention that the Arbitrators suggested by the DJB were \nfrom its panel is incorrect.  She also referred to an Office Order being  \nOO No.26 dated 17.12.2020, issued by the Office of the Law Officer, \nDJB and submitted that the said Office Order, for including the nam es \nof two former Judges suggested by the DJB on their panel, w as issued \non 17.12.2020 which was after the date when their names had bee n \nsuggested by the DJB.   \n \n  \nARB.P.14/2021                                          Page 8 of 13  \n 15. She also referred to a circular dated 25.08.2020, which sets out \nthe procedure to be adopted for appointment of an Arbitral Tri bunal in \nlight of the judgments passed by the Supreme Court and the High  \nCourt.  The said circular indicates that the concerned engineering \nofficer is required to file a request to the High Court for appoint ment \nof an Arbitrator from the panel maintained by the Delhi Internati onal \nArbitration Centre (DIAC) or at its own discretion.  \n16. Mr. Singh countered the aforesaid submissions and stated that \naverments to the aforesaid effect were not included in the petition filed \nby the petitioner but were made in the rejoinder and therefore, the DJB \nhad no opportunity to traverse the said averments.  However, he stated \non instructions that although the order including the nam es of the two \nArbitrators suggested by the DJB was passed on 17.12.2020",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court considered bail application No.28/2021 filed by Bharat Abhilash under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The application arose from FIR No.115/2018, which alleged offences under Sections 376, 306, 506, 323 and 109 IPC and Sections 6 and 17 of the POCSO Act. The alleged victim, a minor aged 16 at the time, claimed repeated sexual assaults by the accused and others. The petitioner argued that his wife had already been granted bail, that he was the sole breadwinner, that the victim’s statements were inconsistent and recorded under the influence of poison, and that the investigation violated Section 35 of the POCSO Act by not completing evidence collection within 30 days. He also cited several Supreme Court precedents supporting bail in similar circumstances. The State opposed, emphasizing the seriousness of the gang‑rape allegations, the victim’s corroborated statements, and the fact that the petitioner and his wife were arrested after a prolonged period due to alleged absconding. The Court noted the gravity of the charges, the incomplete victim testimony, and the pandemic‑related trial delays, concluding that bail could not be granted. Accordingly, the application was dismissed without expressing any opinion on the merits of the underlying criminal case.",
    "facts": "On 11 April 2018 a medical report (MLC) was filed at Paschim Vihar police station. The victim, a 16‑year‑old girl, alleged that the accused Ram Lal (also known as Ganna) repeatedly raped her, threatening to kill her parents. The FIR (No.115/2018) was lodged on 13 January 2018 under Sections 376, 306, 506, 323, 109 IPC and Sections 6 and 17 of the POCSO Act. The victim’s statements were recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. The petitioner, Bharat Abhilash, was arrested on 17 January 2020, more than 1.5 years after the FIR, and has been in judicial custody since. The victim’s medical reports indicated pesticide consumption and UPT positivity. The victim’s examination‑in‑chief was ongoing at the time of the bail hearing.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that (i) the petitioner’s wife had already obtained bail, warranting parity; (ii) the petitioner is the family’s sole supporter and his prolonged custody is unjustified; (iii) the victim’s statements were unreliable, recorded under the influence of poison, and she could not identify the petitioner; (iv) the investigation violated Section 35 of the POCSO Act by not completing evidence collection within 30 days; and (v) cited Supreme Court decisions (Vinay v Karnataka, Siddharam Mhetre v Maharashtra, Panchhi v UP, Dataram Singh v Uttar Pradesh) supporting bail in similar contexts. The State’s APP contended that the offences are grave gang‑rape of a minor, the victim’s statements are corroborated by medical reports, the petitioner was arrested after a legitimate investigation, and bail would jeopardise the investigation and public interest.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the allegations involve a serious gang‑rape of a minor, supported by medical evidence and the victim’s recorded statements. The petitioner’s claim of procedural lapse under Section 35 POCSO was rejected as the investigation and evidence collection were ongoing. The Court noted that the victim’s testimony, though incomplete, was being examined‑in‑chief and could not be dismissed. The delay in arrest was explained by the petitioner’s alleged absconding, not by investigative negligence. Given the gravity of the offences, the risk of tampering with evidence, and the public interest in ensuring a fair trial, the Court concluded that bail could not be granted and dismissed the application.",
    "key_legal_points": [
      "The seriousness of gang‑rape of a minor outweighs the petitioner’s personal hardships.",
      "Procedural delays do not automatically merit bail where investigation is ongoing.",
      "Medical evidence and victim’s statements under Sections 161/164 Cr.P.C. were deemed credible.",
      "Section 35 POCSO procedural requirement was not fatal to bail denial.",
      "Pandemic‑related trial delays do not justify bail in grave offences."
    ],
    "legal_issues": [
      "Whether the petitioner is entitled to bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. despite serious charges.",
      "Whether the investigation complied with Section 35 of the POCSO Act.",
      "Whether the victim’s statements, recorded under alleged intoxication, are reliable for bail consideration.",

    "summary": "The appellants – Eveready Industries India Ltd, McLeod Russel Pvt Ltd and McNally Bharat Engineering Co. Ltd – filed appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 challenging a single‑judge order dated 23‑Nov‑2020 that upheld an interim injunction restraining them from dealing with their assets and altering their capital structure. The injunction stemmed from a Section 9 petition filed by KKR India Financial Services Ltd (a non‑banking financial company) and its security trustee, seeking to enforce a Facility Agreement dated 27‑Sept‑2017 entered with two borrowers, guarantors and an obligor. The respondents argued that the appellants, identified as “Reference Entities” in the agreement, were liable for the loan and therefore fell within the “Group Companies Doctrine”. The appellants contended they had no privity of contract, were not parties to the Facility Agreement, and thus the court lacked jurisdiction to restrain them. The High Court, after hearing counsel and reviewing written submissions, considered the definitions in the Facility Agreement and the scope of Section 9. It ultimately disposed of the appeals, affirming the lower court’s injunction on the ground that the appellants, as reference entities, could be subject to the injunction despite the absence of a direct contractual relationship.",
    "facts": "The respondents, a financial services company and its security trustee, entered into a Facility Agreement with two borrowers, guarantors and an obligor for a loan of INR 100 crore. The agreement contained guarantees and security provisions, and identified certain group companies as “Reference Entities”. The borrowers defaulted, prompting the respondents to invoke Section 9 of the Arbitration Act to obtain an interim injunction restraining the borrowers, guarantors, obligor and the reference entities (the appellants) from dealing with their assets or altering their capital structure. The single judge granted the injunction on 13‑Dec‑2019 and dismissed an application for its vacation on 23‑Nov‑2020. The appellants appealed, claiming no contractual liability and lack of jurisdiction.",
    "arguments": "Appellants argued (i) they are not parties to the Facility Agreement and have no privity of contract; (ii) the definitions of Guarantor, Obligor, Pledgor and Security Provider do not apply to them; (iii) they are merely “Reference Entities” without obligations, so the court cannot restrain them under Section 9. Respondents argued (i) the Facility Agreement’s Group Companies Doctrine extends liability to reference entities; (ii) the loan was granted on the basis of the collective creditworthiness of the group, including the appellants; (iii) the injunction is necessary to protect the security interests of the lenders.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the Facility Agreement’s clauses, particularly the definition of “Reference Entity”, and held that the agreement expressly contemplated the inclusion of such entities within the security framework. It reasoned that Section 9 of the Arbitration Act permits a court to grant interim relief to preserve the status quo pending arbitration, and that the respondents’ claim of a collective guarantee justified extending the injunction to the reference entities. Consequently, the Court affirmed the lower court’s order, finding that the appellants could be restrained despite the absence of a direct contractual relationship.",

The claimant was riding a TVS Vicky when a UPSRTC bus, allegedly traveling at high speed, collided with his vehicle at the Loni Gol Chakkar round‑about. UPSRTC contends that the claimant’s own rash and negligent driving caused the accident, asserting that the bus was stationary at a red light and the claimant applied sudden brakes, leading to a skid. The tribunal examined cross‑examinations, a joint written statement, and a mechanical inspection report showing fresh damage on the claimant’s bike consistent with impact from the bus. The court noted contradictions in the driver’s testimony, the fabricated nature of the joint statement, and the nature of the injuries (fracture of ankle and foot) indicating blunt‑force impact rather than abrasions typical of a skid. Applying the pre‑ponderance of probabilities test, the court found no infirmity in the tribunal’s award and dismissed the appeal.

In support of his claim the injured appeared as PW1. In his \ntestimony he has deposed that the offending bus was being dri ven at a \nhigh speed and in a rash and negligent manner and it had hit his TVS \nVicky, due to which he fell on the road and sustained grievous  \ninjuries. He has specifically deposed that when he reached under th e \nflyover at Loni Gol Chakkar (round about), at about 01:45 p m, the \noffending bus being driven by its driver at a very high s peed, rashly \nand negligently, violating traffic rules and regulations su ddenly came \nfrom Loni Gol Chakkar (round about) side hit him, resultantly,  he fell \ndown and received grievous injuries.  \n5. The Appellants had alleged that the accident was caused du e to \nrash and negligent driving of the injured/claimant. The Trib unal has \nnoticed that the involvement  of the offending bus has not been  \ndisputed.  \n6. The Tribunal has further noticed that there was clear \ncontradiction between the cross examination conducted on be half of \nthe driver of the offending bus and on behalf of the Appellant \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003065\n \n \nMAC. APP. 5/2021 Page 3 of 4  \n \n UPSRTC in the manner in which the accident had taken place.  \n7. During cross examination on behalf of the driver of the \noffending bus, the  injured/claimant categorically denied the \nsuggestion that the accident was caused as TVS Vicky was bein g \ndriven by him at high speed and he fell down after applying s udden \nbreak.  \n8. During cross-examined by learned counsel for UPSRTC, it was \nsuggested to the witness that he was driving TVS Vicky at hi gh speed \nand that he “took sudden turn and skidded on the road and hit agai nst \nbus station at the red light and sustained injuries. ” \n9. The Tribunal has further noticed that the said suggestion on  \nbehalf of the Appellant/UPSRTC was also contradicted by the joi nt \nwritten statement filed by the appellant and the driver where in it had \nbeen alleged that the accident had taken place when the \ninjured/claimant suddenly applied breaks near the offending ve hicle \nwhich was parked at that time, as traffic light was red. \n10. The Tribunal has also relied upon the mechanical inspection \nreport of the vehicle of the claimant which was found to have fresh  \ndamage on the right side and on the rear side which corroborated t he \nfact that the vehicle was hit by the offending bus.  \n11. The tribunal further noticed that the driver of the offending bus \nexamined himself as R1W1. However in his statement he never \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003065\n \n \nMAC.

Furthermore, from the discharge summary produced by the \nclaimant it is observed that the nature of injuries sustain ed are fracture \nof the right ankle and foot and the right fabula. The nature of i njuries \nsustained by the claimant are suggestive more of a blunt force impact  \nrather than injuries caused by slipping/skidding on the road  which \nwould be more in the nature of abrasive injuries. In any event t he test \nin such cases to be applied is on the touchstone of prepond erance of \nprobabilities. Which test, has been correctly applied by the tribunal . \n13. In view of the above, there is no infirmity in the impugned \naward or any merit in the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is \ndismissed.  \n14.

    "summary": "The petition filed by Rajesh Kumar challenged the Armed Forces Tribunal’s order rejecting his claim for a disability pension. The petitioner argued that his mental disorder, which manifested within three months of enrolment, was either caused by or aggravated by military service, invoking Supreme Court precedents that presume service‑related disability when no prior record exists. The High Court examined the medical board’s findings, the timing of symptom onset (12 December 2012), and the short nine‑month service period. It noted that the disability arose shortly after enrolment, making a causal link to service tenuous. The Court relied on Dharmavir Singh’s principles that the burden of proof lies on the employer and on Narsingh Yadav, which cautioned against a mechanical presumption of service‑related disability. Concluding that the petitioner’s service duration was insufficient to cause the disorder and that the medical board’s opinion was not rebutted by strong evidence, the Court upheld the Tribunal’s decision and dismissed the writ petition.",
    "facts": "Petitioner Rajesh Kumar enlisted on 24 September 2012. Within three months (by 12 December 2012) he exhibited psychotic symptoms during basic training. He was admitted to Base Hospital, Delhi Cantt., and later declared medically unfit. The Armed Forces Tribunal, relying on the Invaliding Medical Board (IMB), rejected his claim for a disability pension, holding the disorder not attributable to service. The petitioner sought a pension from 26 June 2013 at 60% (rounded to 75%) with interest.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner contended that the disorder manifested during training, thus attributable to service, and that the medical board made no note of any disability at enrolment, invoking Dharmavir Singh (2013) which presumes service‑related disability in such cases. He argued that the burden of proof lies on the employer and that reasonable doubt should favor the claimant. Respondents relied on the IMB’s assessment, the short service period, and the principle that each case must be examined individually, citing Narsingh Yadav (2019) against a blanket presumption.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the three‑month interval between enrolment and symptom onset was insufficient to establish a causal link between military service and the mental disorder. It affirmed the IMB’s finding that the disability was neither attributable nor aggravated by service, emphasizing that the burden of proof rests on the employer and that the medical board’s opinion stands unless contradicted by strong evidence. The Court also reiterated that mental disorders may escape detection at enrolment, but this does not automatically render them service‑related. Consequently, the Tribunal’s order was upheld and the petition dismissed.",

Present writ petition has been filed challenging the order d ated \n26th February, 2020 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal – Principal Bench, \nNew Delhi in OA No. 470/2015, whereby petitioner’s claim for disability \npension has been rejected.  Petitioner also prays for a direction to the \nrespondents to grant disability pension to the petitioner w.e.f. 26th June, \n2013 @ 60% (rounding off 75%) along with interest @18% th ereon.  The \nrelevant portion of the impugned order is reproduced hereinbelow:-  \n“6. On careful perusal of the medical documents, it has been \nobserved that the applicant was enrolled on 24.09.2012 a nd the \ndisease had first started on 12.12.2012 i.e. within three  months of \njoining the service. He was administered treatment at Base \nHospital, Delhi Cantt. On admission in the Hospital the case \nhistory of the applicant was endorsed by Lt Col Siddharth  Dixit, \nW.P. (C) 46/2021                                                                          Page 2 of 6 \n Classified Specialist (Psy) as under:- \n \nHistory of present illness . This recruit ·was apparently well \nabout till last wk of Nov 12 while undergoing recruitment \ntraining at Raj Rif (wef 24 Sep 2012 till 12 Dec 12), He was \nnoted to remain aloof, socially withdrawn and crying \nintermittently. He felt people around him are plott ing against \nhim and trying to harm him. He became anxious, fearful, and \nkept to himself. He was heard claiming \"gaon walon nai jaal \nbichaya hai woh chalnai main rukawat dalate hain tab main \ntheek say chal nahin paata.\" He was seen by his colleagues to \nmuttering and gesticulating also. He has complained  of \nhearing voices of person commenting in derogatory manner \nand threatening him (maar doonga bahar aa sonai nahin \ndoonga). He was worried and tried intermittently. He \nneglected personal hygiene and food intake. Over another \nweek he stopped attending to routine duties at training centre \nand remained awake at the night. Noticing his behavioural \nabnormalities he was admitted along with escorts for further \nmanagement by psychiatrist at BHDC. He h/o fever he ad \ninjury or substance abuse. \n \nxxxx xxxx xxx \n \nManagement Recommended . In view of genetic loading first \ndegree relative, poor response to treatment modality and \nonset of psychotic breakdown during recruit phase of training \nhe is unlikely to withstand stress and strain of soldiers life. \nHence recommended to be invalided out of service.xx xxxx \n \n7. In the above scenario, we are of the option that since the \ndisease has started in less than three months of his e nrolment, \nhence by no stretch of imagination, it can be concluded th at it has \nbeen caused by stress and strains of military service. Addi tionally, \nit is well known that mental disorders can escape detectio n at the \ntime of enrolment hence benefit of doubt cannot be given to  the \napplicant merely on the ground that the disease could n ot be \ndetected at the time of enrolment. Since there is no casual \nconnection between this disease and military service, hence we \nare in agreement with the opinion of the IMB that the disea se is \nW.P. (C) 46/2021                                                                          Page 3 of 6 \n NANA. Additionally, a recruit is akin to a probationer and hence \nprima facie the respondents as an employer have every right to  \ndischarge a recruit who is not meeting the medical requi rement of \nmilitary service and is not likely to become a good soldier. In view \nof the foregoing and the fact that the disease manifested in less \nthan three months, of enrolment, we are in agreement with the \nopinion of IMB that the disease is NANA.”  \n \n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner  was not \nsuffering from any disability at the time of enrollment and was fo und to be \nmedically fit at that time by the medical board. He points out that the \npetitioner developed the disability during basic training and  therefore, the \npetitioner is entitled to the disability pension.  He emphasizes that the disease \nof the petitioner is either attributable to or aggravated due to stress and strain \nof military service as the Medical Board made no note of the disease at t he \ntime of enrolment. In support of his submission, he relies up on the judgment \nof the Supreme Court in Dharmavir Singh Vs. Union of India & Ors., \n(2013)7 SCC 316 , wherein it has been held as under:-  \n“29. A conjoint reading of various provisions, reprodu ced above, \nmakes it clear that: \n29.1 Disability pension to be granted to an individua l who is \ninvalidated from service on account of a disability whic h is \nattributable to or aggravated by military service in non-b attle \ncasualty and is assessed at 20% or over. The question wheth er a \ndisability is attributable or aggravated by military s ervice to be \ndetermined under “Entitlement Rules for Casualty Pensio nary \nAwards, 1982\" of Appendix-II (Regulation 173). \n \n29.2 A member is to be presumed in sound physical and m ental \ncondition upon entering service if there is no note or rec ord at the \ntime of entrance. In the event of his subsequently being discha rged \nW.P. (C) 46/2021                                                                          Page 4 of 6 \n from service on medical grounds any deterioration in hi s health is \nto be presumed due to service. [Rule 5 r/w Rule 14(b)]. \n \n29.3 Onus of proof is not on the claimant (employee), the \ncorollary is that onus of proof that the condition for  non-\nentitlement is with the employer. A claimant has a right to  derive \nbenefit of any reasonable doubt and is entitled for pe nsionary \nbenefit more liberally. (Rule 9). \n \n29.4 If a disease is accepted to have been as having arisen in \nservice, it must also be established that the conditions of  military \nservice determined or contributed to the onset of the disea se and \nthat the conditions were due to the circumstances of duty in \nmilitary service. [Rule 14(c)]. \n \n29.5 If no note of any disability or disease was made at  the time \nof individual's acceptance for military service, a disease which ha s \nled to an individual's discharge or death will be deemed t o have \narisen in service. [14(b)]. \n \n29.6 If medical opinion holds that the disease could n ot have \nbeen detected on medical examination prior to the acceptan ce for \nservice and that disease will not be deemed to have arisen duri ng \nservice, the Medical Board is required to state the reasons.  \n[14(b)]; and \n \n29.7 It is mandatory for the Medical Board to follow the \nguidelines laid down in Chapter-II of the \"Guide to Medical  \n(Military Pension), 2002 – \"Entitledment : General Principles\", \nincluding paragraph 7,8 and 9 as referred to above. ” \n \n3. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, this Court  finds \nthat the petitioner was enrolled on 24th September, 2012 and as noted in the \nimpugned order, he started developing symptoms attributable to the \ndisease/disability within three months and had to be treated at Bas e Hospital, \nDelhi Cantt. The date of origin of the disability is noted as 12th December, \n2012 in the medical board proceedings, which is annexed to the present \nW.P. (C) 46/2021                                                                          Page 5 of 6 \n petition. The total period of service is only nine months as the peti tioner was \nboarded out on 25th June, 2013.  \n4. Consequently, this Court is of the view that the Invalidin g Medical \nBoard [IMB] as well as the tribunal were correct in holding that t he \ndisability was neither attributable nor aggravated by milit ary service as the \ntime spent in service was too short to cause stress or strain th at might lead to \nsuch a disability.  \n5. Further, this Court is also in agreement with the Tribunal that  certain \nmental disorders might escape detection at the time of enrollment  by the \nMedical Board. The Supreme Court in Narsingh Yadav v. Union of India, \n(2019) 9 SCC 667  has held that there cannot be a mechanical application of \nthe principle that “any disorder not mentioned at the time of enrollment is \npresumed to be attributed to or aggravated by milit ary service”.  Every case \nhas to be examined and it has to be ascertained whether the duti es assigned \nto the individual might have lead to the disorder. The Supreme Co urt while \nconfirming the findings of the IMB in the said case, wherein the a ppellant \nhad been in service for more than three years, held as under:-  \n“18. Therefore, each case has to be examined whether the duties \nassigned to the individual may have led to stress and st rain leading \nto psychosis and psychoneurosis. Relapsing forms of ment al \ndisorders which have intervals of normality and epilepsy  are \nundetectable diseases while carrying out physical examina tion on \nenrolment, unless adequate history is given at the time by  the \nmember. \n \n19. The appellant was a young boy of 18 years at the time o f \nenrolment and had been boarded within 3½ years of his serv ice. \nEven if he was suffering from any mental disorder prior t o \nenrolment, the same could not be detected as there were intervals  \nof normality. The appellant was posted in peace station as a \nVehicle Mechanic. Neither the nature of job nor the place o f \nW.P. (C) 46/2021                                                                          Page 6 of 6 \n posting was such which could have caused stress and strain leading \nto disability as attributed to or aggravated by military servi ce. \n \n20. In the present case, Rule 14(d), as amended in the year 1 996 \nand reproduced above, would be applicable as entitlement to \ndisability pension shall not be considered unless it i s clearly \nestablished that the cause of such disease was adversely aff ected \ndue to factors related to conditions of military serv ice. Though, the \nprovision of grant of disability pension is a beneficia l provision \nbut, mental disorder at the time of recruitment cannot no rmally be \ndetected when a person behaves normally. Since there is a \npossibility of non-detection of mental disorder, therefo re, it cannot \nbe said that schizophrenia is presumed to be attribut ed to or \naggravated by military service. \n21. Though, the opinion of the Medical Board is subject to judicial \nreview but the courts are not possessed of expertise to dispu te such \nreport unless there is strong medical evidence on record to d ispute \nthe opinion of the Medical Board which may warrant the  \nconstitution of the Review Medical Board. The invaliding M edical \nBoard has categorically held that the appellant is no t fit for further \nservice and there is no material on record to doubt the co rrectness \nof the report of the invaliding Medical Board.”  \n \n6. In view of the aforesaid as well as the report of the IMB, this Court is \nnot inclined to interfere with the impugned order.  \n7. Consequently, the present petition is dismissed. \n \n     MANMOHAN, J \n \n \n \n      ASHA MENON, J \nAPRIL 08, 2021 \nKA",

    "summary": "The Delhi High Court heard three civil writ petitions (WP(C) 33, 43 and 49 of 2021) filed by former armed forces personnel seeking pro‑rata pension similar to that awarded in earlier judgments (Brijlal Kumar v. Union of India, 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1477 and Govind Kumar Srivastava v. Union of India, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 6425). The petitioners, represented by Ms. Pallavi Awasthi, claimed they were similarly situated to the earlier petitioners and had filed the requisite No‑Objection Certificates. The respondents, Union of India, argued that verification and the right to appeal to the Supreme Court should be preserved. The Court, after video‑conferenced hearing, directed the Indian Air Force to verify the petitioners' eligibility within twelve weeks and, if found eligible, to pay arrears of pro‑rata pension from the date of discharge, with interest at 7% per annum on delayed payments. If any petitioner is found ineligible, the respondents must provide written reasons. The order was to be uploaded online and communicated to counsel. The judgment essentially extends the relief granted in the earlier cases, subject to verification, thereby allowing the petitioners to claim pro‑rata pension.",
    "facts": "Three former armed forces personnel—Shivashish Shubham, Pradeep Chandra Nahak and Vipin Kumar Yadav—filed writ petitions claiming entitlement to pro‑rata pension. They asserted that they were in the same position as petitioners in the Brijlal Kumar and Govind Kumar Srivastava cases, for which the Court had ordered payment of pro‑rata pension. The petitioners submitted No‑Objection Certificates and sought the same relief. The Union of India, as respondent, contested the claim, emphasizing the need for verification and preserving the right to appeal any adverse decision to the Supreme Court.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the earlier judgments set a precedent granting pro‑rata pension to similarly placed former service members and that they satisfied all procedural requirements, including filing NOCs. Respondents contended that each case must be individually verified, that the right to appeal to the Supreme Court should remain intact, and that the Court should not grant relief without confirming eligibility.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the petitioners' situation mirrors that of the earlier cases and that the relief granted therein was based on the principle of equity for similarly situated former service members. However, it emphasized the necessity of verification to ensure that the petitioners meet the criteria established in the precedent cases. The Court therefore ordered verification within twelve weeks and directed payment of arrears and future pro‑rata pension if eligibility is confirmed, with interest on delayed payments. It also preserved the respondents' right to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

The petitioner claimed that his property is protected under the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Act, 2017, and that no statement was made to apply for regularisation of the unauthorised construction. The High Court noted that the appeal before the AT‑MCD was still pending and that an interim protection order dated 05.01.2021 barred coercive action against the petitioner. The Court directed that the interim protection continue until the AT‑MCD decides the appeal, but the petitioner must not carry out any further construction. The Court also instructed the AT‑MCD to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law without any special equity. All rights and contentions of the parties were reserved. The petition was therefore disposed with the continuation of interim protection.",
    "facts": "The petitioner owned a property for which a demolition order was issued on 06.10.2017 by the municipal authority. He appealed the demolition order, and the appeal was pending before the AT‑MCD. On 25.11.2020 the High Court dismissed his petition, noting a statement that the petitioner would apply for regularisation. The petitioner contended that no such statement was made and that the property is protected under the 2017 amendment Act. An interim protection order dated 05.01.2021 prevented coercive action against him.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the property is covered by the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Act, 2017, and that no admission was made to seek regularisation, thus entitling him to interim protection. Respondents relied on the earlier demolition order and the alleged statement by the petitioner indicating intent to regularise, seeking enforcement of demolition.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the appeal before the AT‑MCD remained pending and that an interim protection order already barred coercive action. Since the appeal had not been decided, the Court could not grant any further relief beyond preserving the status quo.

The petitioner claimed to act as a public‑spirited individual but failed to comply with the Delhi High Court (Public Interest Litigation) Rules, 2010, which require a declaration of no personal interest. The court observed that the petitioner’s father‑in‑law was a partner in the entities against which the complaints were lodged, and the petitioner’s wife stood to benefit from any settlement, indicating a personal motive. Consequently, the petition was deemed an abuse of process and not a bona‑fide public interest litigation. The counsel for the petitioner withdrew the petition, and the court dismissed it with liberty to approach the Income Tax Department under the Informants Scheme, if appropriate.",
    "facts": "The petitioner filed two Tax Evasion Petitions against M/s Jagdish Prasad Agarwal and M/s Vijay Automobiles, alleging tax evasion and seeking investigation under the Informants Rewards Scheme.

JUSTICE SANJEEV NARULA  \n    O R D E R  \n%    05.01.2021  \n[VIA VIDEO CONFERENCING] \n1. The petitioner seeks mandamus to the respondents  (i) Directorate of \nIncome Tax Investigation; and, (ii) Member Investig ation, Central Board of \nDirect Taxes, to conduct an investigation in a time  bound manner in \npursuance to the Tax Evasion Petition (TEP) dated 2 0th June, 2020 and \nBenami Transaction Tax Evasion Petition dated 18th March, 2020 lodged by  \nthe petitioner with the respondents against M/s Jag dish Prasad Agarwal \n(JPA) & M/s Vijay Automobiles and to treat the said  TEPs under the Income \nTax Informants Rewards Scheme, 2018. \n2. The petitioner had not impleaded the aforesaid M /s JPA or M/s Vijay \nAutomobiles as respondents to this petition. \n3. The petitioner, in the petition has pleaded that  the petition is filed by \nhim as a public spirited person. However, in spite of the said averment, the \nsame has not been labelled as a Public Interest Lit igation and is not in \nW.P.(C) 54/2021     Page 2 of 3 \n compliance with the Delhi High Court (Public Intere st Litigation) Rules, \n2010 for filing Public Interest Litigation and whic h Rules inter alia require \nthe petitioner to make a declaration that there is no personal interest in the \nlitigation and that the petition is not guided by s elf-gain or for gain of any \nother person/institution/body and that there is no motive other than of public \ninterest. Rather, the petitioner in the petition ha s expressly pleaded that his \nfather-in-law, Late Shri Jagdish Prasad Agarwal, wa s a partner in M/s JPA \nand M/s Vijay Automobiles against whom complaints o f tax evasion have \nbeen made and that the other partners of the said M /s JPA and M/s Vijay \nAutomobiles have not settled the accounts with the legal heirs of Late Shri \nJagdish Prasad Agarwal, being the father-in-law of the petitioner and one of \nwhich legal heirs, Smt. Usha Singhal, is the wife o f the petitioner. Thus \nprima facie  it appears that TEPs filed by the petitioner or by  any of the other \nlegal heirs or at their instance as well as this pe tition, are to coerce the said \nM/s JPA and M/s Vijay Automobiles to settle the cla ims, inter alia of the \npetitioner’s wife. \n4. The same cannot be permitted and is an abuse of the process of the \nCourt.  The Court cannot allow its machinery and pr ocess to be used and \ninvoked by such unscrupulous petitioners, to settle  their own scores. \n5. Though certain schemes brought out by the Income  Tax Department \nencourage the filing of complaints of income tax ev asion to be made and \nwhich can obviously be made only by insiders who ha ve fallen apart from \nthe entity/person earlier indulging in tax evasion,  but the petitioner, though \nreferring to the same, has not filed any copy of th e said scheme and has not \nshown any provision under which the petitioner, bes ides lodging a complaint \nor furnishing information, has a right to activate the Court machinery to \nW.P.(C) 54/2021     Page 3 of 3 \n issue mandamus to the respondent to take further ac tion against  the person/s \ncomplained against. \n6. Be that as it may, such abuse of process of this  Court cannot be \npermitted. \n7. The counsel for the petitioner, who is young wit h only three years of \nexperience at the Bar as informed, states that he r ealises his mistake and \nwithdraws the petition, without any liberty to purs ue the misconceived \naction any further but with liberty to take steps u nder the Informants \nScheme, if any, of the Income Tax Department. \n8. Dismissed as withdrawn with liberty aforesaid. \n \n \n \n \n       RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.  \n \n \n \n       SANJEEV NARULA, J.  \nJANUARY 5, 2021 \nSU",

    "summary": "The appellant, M/S Trehun Sons, challenged a series of orders issued by the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) demanding payment of employee contributions for the period June 2006 to June 2011. The dispute originated from a Show Cause Notice dated 25 July 2011 under Sections 85(a) and 85(e) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948. The appellant appealed the notice and subsequent orders before the Senior Civil Judge (Rent Controller) and the Employees' Insurance Court, which dismissed the appeals. The appellant then filed an appeal before the Delhi High Court under Section 82 of the Act, contending that the Employees' Insurance Court erred by not impleading the workers, who are the statutory beneficiaries, as parties. The Court examined Supreme Court precedents emphasizing that labour statutes are beneficial legislation and that non‑joinder of necessary parties defeats natural justice. Citing cases such as Fertilizers & Chemicals Travancore Ltd., ESIC v. Bhakra Beas Management Board, and ESIC v. Key Dee Cold Storage, the High Court held that the absence of the workers as parties rendered the earlier proceedings infirm. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the matter remanded to the Senior Civil Judge for fresh adjudication, and the pending applications were disposed of.",
    "facts": "ESIC issued a Show Cause Notice on 25 July 2011 demanding Rs.4,79,050 as employee contributions for the period 01‑06‑2006 to June 2011. The appellant, employing at least 20 workers, contested the notice, leading to a speaking order on 17 January 2012 under Section 45‑A, which was appealed under Section 45‑AA and dismissed on 5 July 2012. The appellant further appealed before the Employees' Insurance Court under Sections 75, 76 and 77, but the appeal was dismissed on 3 November 2020. The appellant argued that the workers were not impleaded as parties, violating the principles of natural justice and the protective purpose of the Act.",
    "arguments": "The appellant argued that the Employees' Insurance Court failed to implead the workers, who are the real beneficiaries under the Act, thereby breaching the requirement of natural justice and rendering the proceedings void. The respondent ESIC contended that the procedural aspects were regular and that the contribution demand was enforceable irrespective of worker participation.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the Employees' State Insurance Act is a beneficial legislation intended primarily for workers. Supreme Court jurisprudence mandates that workers (or their representatives) be impleaded in any proceeding under the Act. Non‑joinder of a necessary party goes to the root of the matter and makes the order a nullity. Since the Employees' Insurance Court did not include the workers, its decision was infirm. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the matter remanded for fresh adjudication with proper joinder of the workers.",

A perusal of the paper book would show that the present proceedings \noriginate from a Show Cause Notice dated 25.07.2011 issued by ESIC under \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003290\nFAO 2/2021                                                        Page 2 of 6  Sections 85(a) and 85(e) of the Act, whereby the appellant was asked  to \ndeposit employees' contribution of Rs.4,79,050/- for the peri od from \n01.06.2006 to June, 2011. The aforesaid notice culminated into passing of a \nspeaking order dated 17.01.2012 under Section 45-A of the Ac t, which was \nchallenged by the appellant by way of an appeal under Section  45-AA of the \nAct. The same came to be dismissed vide order dated 05.07.2012, wh ich in \nturn was challenged before the learned SCJ by way of an appeal fi led under \nSection 75 read with Sections 76 & 77 of the Act. The said appeal  came to \nbe dismissed by way of the order impugned herein. \n3. It is worthwhile to note that the entire case revolves aroun d the \nallegation that despite having employed atleast 20 employees an d thus being \ncovered under the Act, the appellant has not paid the requisite contrib ution. \n4. There is no gainsaying that labour statutes, such as th e Act, constitute \n‘beneficial legislation ’, enacted for the welfare of employees/workmen. \nBesides ESIC, such workmen/employees, are also to be necessarily \nimpleaded in petitions filed under Section 75 of the Act thro ugh self or in \nrepresentative capacity. In this regard, this Court deems it exp edient to \nadvert to the following observations made by the Supreme Court in \nFertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Limited v. Regional Director, \nEmployees’ State Insurance Corporation and Others reported as (2009) 9 \nSCC 485:-  \n\"8. In our opinion, wherever any petition is filed by an employer \nunder Section 75 of the Act, the employer has not only to \nimplead the ESIC but has also to implead at least some of the \nworkers concerned (in a representative capacity if there are a \nlarge number of workers) or the trade union representing t he \nsaid workers. If that is not done, and a decision is giv en in \nfavour of the employer, the same will be in violation o f the rules \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003290\nFAO 2/2021                                                        Page 3 of 6  of natural justice. After all, the real parties concerned i n labour \nmatters are the employer and the workers. ESI Corporation wi ll \nnot be in any way affected if the demand notice sent by it under \nSection 45-A/45-B is quashed. \n \n9.  It must be remembered that the Act has been enacted for th e \nbenefit of the workers to give them medical benefits, which h ave \nbeen mentioned in Section 46 of the Act. Hence, the princi pal \nbeneficiary of the Act is the workmen and not ESI Corporatio n. \nESI Corporation is only the agency to implement and carry out \nthe object of the Act and it has nothing to lose if th e decision of \nthe Employees' Insurance Court is given in favour of the \nemployer. It is only the workmen who have to lose if a decisi on \nis given in favour of the employer. Hence, the workmen (or at  \nleast some of them in a representative capacity, or their tr ade \nunion) have to be necessarily made a party/parties because the \nAct is a labour legislation made for the benefit of the workmen . \n \n10. In the present case the workmen concerned were not made \nparties before the Employees ’ Insurance Court, nor was notice \nissued to them by the said court. Also, the order of the  \nEmployees' Insurance Court dated 4-2-1993, relevant portion  of \nwhich we have quoted, is not a very happy one as no proper \ndetermination has been made therein as to whether the \nworkmen concerned are the employees of the appellant and \nwhether they are entitled to the benefit of the Act. \n \n11. No doubt some observations have been made that some \nlabourers come on one day but they may not come on the next \nday. Having said so, a direction has been given that ESI \nCorporation will after making inquiries about the identi ties of \nthe said workers will register them and then extend the benefi t \nof the Act. \n \n12. In our opinion, the Employees' Insurance Court should have \nitself made a proper investigation of the facts after g etting \nevidence from the parties, including the workmen concerned, \nand after impleading them as party in the petition, it  should \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003290\nFAO 2/2021                                                        Page 4 of 6  have determined the question as to whether the persons \nconcerned were the employees of the appellant or not. ” \n \n5. Subsequently, the above observations have been reiterated by  the \nSupreme Court in Employees ’ State Insurance Corporation v. Bhakra Beas \nManagement Board and Another reported as (2009) 10 SCC 671  and \nEmployees State Insurance Corporation and Others v. Key Dee Cold Storage \nPvt. Ltd. reported as 2022 SCC OnLine SC 650 . \n6. In Employees State Insurance Corporation and Others v. Key Dee \nCold Storage Pvt. Ltd. (Supra), the respondent had raised a challenge b efore \nthe ESI Court against a show cause notice for remittance of contribu tion, \nand consequent steps for recovery, however, it failed to implead th e \nfactory’s employees. While enunciating that non-joinder of necessary parties \ngoes to the root of the matter and could also be fatal to a legal proceeding, \nthe Supreme Court observed as follows:- \n“28. This Court in Delhi Gymkhana Club Limited v. Employees' \nState Insurance Corporation , through the opinion of Just ice R. \nBanumathi, noted that the object of the ESI Act is to pro vide \nbenefits to the employees and also to make provisions for \ncertain other matters in relation thereto. As the ESI Act i s a \nbeneficial piece of social welfare legislation aimed at secur ing \nthe well-being of the employees, a restrictive interpretation \nwhich will have the effect of defeating the objects of the \nbeneficial legislation, should be eschewed by the Court. \n \n29. In the present matter, the respondent while challenging th e \nshow cause notice in the EI Court, failed to implead the \nfactory's employees either individually or in representative \ncapacity. Even the Union of India which issued the notific ation \nunder Section 1(3) of the ESI Act expanding coverage of th e \nbeneficial legislation to the area where the factory of th e \nrespondent is located, was not arrayed as a party in the \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003290\nFAO 2/2021                                                        Page 5 of 6  proceeding. In such circumstances, the decision of this Cou rt in \nEmployees' State Insurance Corporation v. Bhakra Beas \nManagement Board and Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore  \nLtd. v. Regional Director, Employees' State Insurance \nCorporation would come into play. \nxxx \n \n32. The above judgments suggest that for non-joinder of \nnecessary parties, the proceeding at the instance of the \nrespondent would not be legally maintainable. Such a plea was \nspecifically raised by the appellants before the High Court  but \nthis was rejected with the observation that the issue oug ht to \nhave been raised before the trial court. In this context, it i s \nnecessary to keep in mind that the Supreme Court judgment i.e.  \nEmployees' State Insurance Corporation (supra) was rendered \non 17.9.2009 whereas the judgment in favour of the app ellants \nwas rendered by the EI Court much earlier on 21.6.2006. \nTherefore, for the appellants, it would have been impossible to  \nrely on the ratio in the subsequent judgment of the Su preme \nCourt to argue on the non-maintainability of the respond ent's \nproceeding, for non-impleadment of the concerned employees. \n \n33. In any case, non-joinder of a necessary party goes to the \nroot of the matter and could also be fatal to a legal p roceeding. \nFor this we can usefully read the opinion of this court in  \nKhetrabasi Biswal v. Ajaya Kumar Baral where it was held as \nfollows: — \n \n“6. The procedural law as well as the substantive law both \nmandates that in the absence of a necessary party, the \norder passed is a nullity and does not have a binding \neffect.”  \n \n7. Keeping in view the above, this Court is of the opinio n that the \npresent matter needs to be remanded back to the learned SCJ to be dec ided \nafresh in light of the aforesaid decisions. The appeal is allowed and  it is \nordered accordingly. \nThis is a digitally signed Judgement.NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2022/DHC/003290\nFAO 2/2021                                                        Page 6 of 6   \n8. Let the present matter be listed before the learned SCJ/Rent Controller \n(West), Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi on 05.09.2022.  \n9.

The GNCT of Delhi, while agreeing to arbitration in two petitions, sought a caveat in the third that the arbitrability and all defences, including limitation, remain open before the arbitral tribunal. The Court, relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Duro Felguera S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd., held that although three separate arbitration agreements exist, the disputes are similar and involve the same parties, warranting referral to a single arbitrator to ensure speedy resolution. The Court clarified that this does not violate the Fifth Schedule of the 1996 Act as the arbitrator has not previously acted in the matter. Accordingly, the disputes were referred to retired Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw as arbitrator, with directions for disclosure under Section 12(2). No merits were decided; all factual and legal issues remain for the arbitrator. The petitions were disposed of.",

These are petitions under Section 11 of the Arbitra tion and \nConciliation Act, 1996 (“the 1996 Act”), seeking re ference of the \ndisputes between the parties to arbitration.   \n \n2. While learned counsel for the GNCTD in Arb.  P. 22/2021 and \nArb. P. 23/2021 was agreeable to the matter being referre d to \narbitration by an arbitrator to be appointed by the  Court, Mr. Dhawan, \nlearned counsel for the respondent in Arb.  P. 24/2021 seek s a caveat, \nwhile appointing the arbitrator , to the effect that the arbitrability of the \ndispute as well as all defences available in law in cluding the plea of \nlimitation should be left open to be agitated befor e the learned Arbitral \nTribunal.  \n \n1\n                                                 \n1 (2017) 9 SCC 729  , there would have to be three separate \narbitrations.   \n \n4. The arbitrator would, therefore, be entitled to thr ee separate \nfees, each of which would be fixed in accordance wi th the Fourth \nSchedule to the 1996 Act , as requested by par ties. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:15.08.2021\n19:21:13Signature Not Verified\nARB.P. 22/2021 & contd. matters                                                  Page 3 of 3 \n  \n5. Inasmuch as the disputes are between the same parti es and are \nsimilar in nature, I deem it appropriate, in order to ensure  an \nexpeditious resolution thereof, that the disputes b e referred to \narbitration by the same arbitrator.  This, in my vi ew, would not infract, \nin any manner, the Fifth Schedule to the 1996 Act o r Serial No. 24 \nthereof, as that applies to a situation in which, at t he time of \nappointment of the arbitrator, he is already servin g or has served in the \npast, as arbitrator for either of the parties in a similar case. No such \ninfirmity  applies in the present case.  \n \n6. As such, the disputes are referred to Hon’ble Mr Justice Rajiv \nSahai Endlaw, a learned retired Judge of this Court,  who is requested \nto arbitrate thereon .

The learned arbitrator would submit the requisite disclosure \nunder Section 12(2) of the 1996 Act within a week o f entering on \nreference.  \n \n8. This Court has not expressed any opinion on the con tentions of \neither of the parties and all issues of facts and l aw remain s open to be \nagitated before the learned arbitrator.  \n \n9.

    "summary": "The plaintiffs, legal heirs of the deceased Lakshmi Venkatachalam, own the copyright in the multi‑volume publication \"Sales Tax Cases\" (STC). They filed four civil suits (C.S. Nos. 158, 159, 160 and 161 of 1998) against M/s. Commercial Laws of India Pvt. Ltd., V. Subramanian, Sekhar and M/s. Company Law Institute of India Pvt.

The suits were filed under Order IV Rule 1 of the O.S. Rules and Sections 55 and 62 of the Copyright Act. The defendants filed written statements undertaking not to use the specified volumes in any future GST law publications or CD‑ROMs. The plaintiffs raised no objection to the undertaking. The Court, after recording the defendants' undertaking, decreed the suits accordingly, granting the injunction as per the undertaking and awarding no costs. The judgment underscores the enforceability of copyright undertakings and the Court's willingness to settle disputes through consent without protracted litigation.",
    "facts": "The plaintiffs own copyright in the printed series \"Sales Tax Cases\". The defendants allegedly reproduced selected volumes of this series in an online publication titled \"STC on line\". The plaintiffs claimed this constituted infringement and sought a permanent injunction to stop further distribution. The defendants submitted written statements undertaking not to use the contested volumes in any future publications or electronic media.",
    "arguments": "Plaintiffs argued that the defendants' online use of the STC volumes violated their exclusive rights under Sections 55 and 62 of the Copyright Act and sought an injunction. Defendants contended that they would cease any further use and offered an undertaking to that effect, requesting the Court to record the undertaking and close the suits.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court noted that the defendants had expressly undertaken not to use the disputed material in the future and that the plaintiffs raised no objection to this undertaking. Under the Copyright Act, such an undertaking is sufficient to prevent further infringement. Consequently, the Court recorded the undertaking, decreed the suits in accordance with it, and awarded no costs, emphasizing the parties' consent and the adequacy of the undertaking to protect the plaintiffs' rights.",

    "primary_legal_issue": "Whether the 3rd respondent can enforce locking, sealing, demolition and de‑occupation notices on a residential building pending the disposal of a special revision petition filed under Section 80‑A of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971.",
    "summary": "The petitioners, owners of residential units in a building constructed in 2001 with approved plans, sought a writ of mandamus to restrain the Greater Chennai Corporation (3rd respondent) from locking, sealing, demolishing or de‑occupying their premises. The 3rd respondent issued a stop‑work notice in September 2020, followed by locking, sealing and demolition notices in November 2020, and a de‑occupation notice on 28 December 2020, alleging unauthorized deviations. The petitioners filed a special revision/appeal under Section 80‑A of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, which remained pending. The High Court, after hearing the government pleaders, declined to entertain the merits of the petitioners’ claim but directed the 1st respondent (Government of Tamil Nadu) to entertain the pending special revision/appeal and to consider interim relief within three weeks. It ordered the 3rd respondent to defer any further action under the de‑occupation notice until the revision is disposed of. The writ petition was therefore disposed of without costs, and the connected miscellaneous petition was closed.",
    "facts": "The building at Plot Nos.10 and 11, Rajendra Colony, Saligramam, Chennai, was constructed in 2001 by M/s Maayapuri Constructions after obtaining planning permission (PPA Nos.480 and 481). The petitioners purchased the units and land shares via registered sale deeds. After nearly two decades, the Greater Chennai Corporation issued a stop‑work notice (07‑09‑2020), ignored the petitioners’ reply, and served locking, sealing (11‑11‑2020) and demolition notices (12‑11‑2020) alleging deviations. The petitioners filed a special revision/appeal under Section 80‑A of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, seeking interim relief. The 3rd respondent later issued a de‑occupation notice (28‑12‑2020).",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the building was lawfully constructed with approved plans, that the notices were issued without due consideration of their reply, and that the pending special revision under Section 80‑A barred any further action, especially given the age and health of many owners. Respondents contended that alleged deviations justified the notices and that the special revision was a procedural matter not precluding enforcement actions.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court noted that the writ petition raised procedural and substantive issues but chose not to delve into the merits. It emphasized the pendency of the special revision/appeal under Section 80‑A and the statutory requirement that the authority entertain such revisions before taking coercive action. Accordingly, the Court directed the 1st respondent to process the revision and consider interim relief within three weeks, and ordered the 3rd respondent to defer any further action, including the de‑occupation notice, until the revision is disposed of.",

    "summary": "In W.P. No. 553 of 2022, petitioners Kaliyamurthy and Sundaravalli sought a writ of mandamus under Article 226 directing the Sub‑Registrar to register a decree dated 24 July 2015 in O.S. No.3 of 2011, issued by the II Additional District Court, Chidambaram. The decree arose from a suit for specific performance of a sale agreement and ordered the petitioners to pay Rs.1,00,000 with interest. After paying the amount and obtaining a certified copy of the decree, the petitioners presented it for registration, but the Sub‑Registrar refused, citing the four‑month limitation period under Sections 23 and 25 of the Indian Registration Act. The petitioners contended that such limitation should not apply to court decrees. The Court, relying on its earlier pronouncements, held that the limitation provisions of the Registration Act are inapplicable to the registration of civil court decrees because a decree is not a compulsorily registrable document. Consequently, the Sub‑Registrar was directed to register the decree forthwith. The writ petition was disposed of with no costs, effectively granting the relief sought.",
    "facts": "The petitioners owned land covered by Survey No.116/2 and New Survey No.484/1 (40 cents). The fourth respondent, Mohammed Ghoose, filed a suit (O.S. No.3 of 2011) for specific performance of a sale agreement dated 04‑04‑2008 and for a refund of Rs.18,00,000 with interest. The suit was dismissed on 24‑07‑2015, with the petitioners ordered to pay Rs.1,00,000 with interest. No appeal was filed. The petitioners paid the amount, obtained a certified copy of the judgment and decree, and approached the Sub‑Registrar for registration. The Sub‑Registrar refused, invoking a four‑month limitation under the Registration Act.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the decree, being a civil court order, should be registrable irrespective of the limitation period and that the Registration Act's Sections 23 and 25 do not apply to such decrees. Respondents (registrars) contended that the four‑month limitation under the Registration Act barred registration after that period.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that earlier decisions have consistently held that Sections 23 and 25 of the Indian Registration Act, which prescribe limitation periods, are not applicable to the registration of civil court decrees. Since a decree is not a document that must be compulsorily registered, the statutory limitation cannot be invoked to deny registration. Accordingly, the Sub‑Registrar was ordered to register the decree immediately.",

Heard, Mr.A.Muthukumar, learned counsel appearing\nfor the petitioners and Mr.Yogesh Kannadasan, learned Special\nGovernment Pleader appearing for the respondents 1 to 3.\n3.  The case of the petitioner is that the property,\ncomprised in survey No.116/2 and New survey No.484/1 to an\nextent of 40 cents, owned by the petitioners.   The fourth\nrespondent instituted a suit in O.S.No.3 of 2011 on the file of\nthe  II  Additional  District  Court,  Chidambaram,  against  the\npetitioners  for  specific  performance  on  the  basis  of  the\nagreement  for  sale  dated  04.04.2008  along  with  alternative\nremedy to refund a sum of Rs.18,00,000/- with interest at the\nrate of 12% per annum.    The said suit was dismissed by a\nJudgment and Decree dated 24.07.2015.  However, the petitioners\nwere directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest at the\nrate of 12% per annum from 05.04.2009 till the date of payment.\nThere is no appeal as against the said Judgment and Decree,\neither by the petitioners or by the fourth respondent herein.\n4.    As directed by the Court below, the petitioners\nalso deposited the amount to the credit of O.S.No.3 of 2011.\nThereafter, the petitioners obtained a certified copy of the\nJudgment and Decree passed in O.S.No.3 of  2011 and presented\nfor registration before the third respondent.  However, the\nthird respondent refused to register the Judgment and Decree for\nthe reason that the decree could not be registered after a\nperiod of four months from the date of Decree.\n5.   This Court repeatedly held that the provisions under\nSections  23  and  25  of  the  Indian  Registration  Act,  which\nprescribes  limitation,  will  not  apply  in  the  case  of\nregistration of any Civil Court Decree.  Since, the decree is\nnot  a  compulsorily  registrable  document  and  the  limitation\nprescribed under the Registration Act would not stand attracted\nfor registering any decree.   Therefore, the third respondent\ncannot refuse to registration of the Court Decree on the ground\nof limitation.\n6.   In view of the above, the petitioners are directed\nto present the Judgment and Decree passed in O.S.No.3 of 2011\ndated 24.07.2015 for registration before the third respondent\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nand on receipt of the same, the third respondent is directed to\nregister and release the same forthwith.\n7.

    "summary": "The petitioner, Divya, filed a Transfer Civil Miscellaneous Petition (Tr.CMP No.9 of 2023) seeking withdrawal of H.M.O.P. No.922 of 2022 pending before the Sub Court, Poonamallee, and its transfer to the Sub Court, Tambaram. The respondent, J. Badrinath, opposed the petition. During the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel produced a memo of compromise indicating that both parties had agreed to settle their disputes by filing a mutual‑consent divorce petition before the Sub Court, Tambaram. The compromise deed, dated 27‑Nov‑2023, stipulated that each party would withdraw their respective petitions (H.M.O.P. No.308 of 2023 and H.M.O.P. No.180 of 2023) and cooperate in filing the divorce petition, with provisions for video‑link appearances and notarized documents from New Jersey, USA. The Court, after reviewing the compromise deed, ordered the transfer petition to be disposed of in terms of the agreement, incorporated the deed’s terms into the order, and closed the connected miscellaneous petition without awarding costs. The judgment reflects the Court’s willingness to honor a mutually agreed compromise that satisfies procedural requirements under Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code, thereby avoiding further litigation.",
    "facts": "Divya filed a petition to withdraw a pending civil miscellaneous petition (H.M.O.P. No.922 of 2022) from the Sub Court, Poonamallee and to transfer the matter to the Sub Court, Tambaram. Both parties later reached a compromise, agreeing to settle their dispute through a mutual‑consent divorce petition and to withdraw related petitions in other courts. The compromise deed was signed, notarized, and presented to the Court.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel submitted a memo of compromise stating that both parties consented to withdraw their respective petitions and to file a mutual‑consent divorce petition. The respondent did not contest the compromise, and both parties agreed to comply with procedural directions, including video‑link appearances and notarized documents from the USA.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the compromise deed dated 27‑Nov‑2023, found it to be a valid settlement under Section 24 of the CPC, and therefore ordered the transfer petition to be disposed of in accordance with the deed.

    "summary": "In C.S. No. 47 of 1996, the plaintiffs K. Sivagnanam and T. S. Pathy filed a civil suit seeking a scheme for the preservation, administration and functioning of a trust created by the first defendant, Tamil Nadu Karuneegar Sangam, and the appointment of trustees from the Karuneegar caste. The suit was filed under Section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code. Despite multiple directions by the court for the plaintiffs' counsel to serve notice and for both sides to appear, neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants presented any representation on the scheduled dates. The court observed that both parties failed to demonstrate any interest in pursuing the matter, rendering further proceedings futile. Consequently, the Madras High Court, presided over by Mrs. Justice V. Bhavani Subbaroyan, dismissed the suit for non‑prosecution, noting that the lack of active participation justified termination of the proceedings. The order was certified as a true copy and entered on 29 April 2022.",

On the hearing date, no party appeared, indicating a lack of interest in pursuing the case.",
    "arguments": "No substantive arguments were presented by either side. The court noted the plaintiffs' counsel's failure to comply with directions and the defendants' lack of instructions, leading to an inference of no interest in the litigation.",

    "summary": "The petitioner, A. Gnanasekaran, a clerk in a cooperative bank, challenged a surcharge order imposed under Section 87 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act. He alleged that the first respondent, the Deputy Registrar, had violated Section 81(4) by not furnishing the enquiry report and denying him a fair hearing. The petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to quash the order and to obtain the complete records. The respondents contended that the enquiry was conducted per statutory procedure, the report was eventually supplied, and the society is not a State instrumentality, rendering the writ inapplicable. The bench examined a Full Bench decision (Writ Appeal No.1573 of 1998) which held that cooperative societies engaged in banking are not State entities under Article 12, and therefore, writ jurisdiction is limited unless a statutory public duty is breached. Applying this precedent, the court concluded that the society could not be treated as a State authority and that the alternative statutory remedy (appeal before the Cooperative Tribunal) was available. Consequently, the writ petition was converted into a civil revision petition and dismissed, with no costs awarded.",
    "facts": "The petitioner worked as a clerk in the Melolakkur Primary Agricultural Co‑op Bank. The Deputy Registrar filed a report against him without providing a copy to the petitioner. Six months later, surcharge proceedings under Section 87 were initiated, imposing a liability of Rs.4.77 lakhs. The petitioner filed a writ petition (W.P. No.41290 of 2004) to obtain the enquiry report, which was later ordered to be furnished. He subsequently filed the present writ petition (W.P. No.9282 of 2009) challenging the surcharge order and alleging procedural violations under Section 81(4).",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the first respondent violated Section 81(4) by not furnishing the enquiry report and denying a fair hearing, rendering the surcharge order illegal. He also claimed that the cooperative society, being a public body, should be amenable to writ jurisdiction. Respondents asserted that the enquiry was conducted in accordance with the Act and Rules, the report was eventually provided, and that the society is not an instrumentality of the State; therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable and the statutory appeal before the Cooperative Tribunal is the appropriate remedy.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court relied on the Full Bench judgment in Writ Appeal No.1573 of 1998, which held that cooperative societies engaged in banking are not State entities under Article 12 and thus not subject to writ jurisdiction unless a specific statutory public duty is breached. It noted that the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act provides an alternative remedy (statutory appeal) and that the bye‑laws of such societies do not have the force of law. Consequently, the writ petition could not lie against the society, and the matter was converted to a civil revision petition.",

The facts, as per the affidavit enclosed to this writ petition are that \nthe petitioner was working as a Clerk in the second res pondent Bank. \nThe  first  respondent  herein  without  giving  opportunity  and  without \nfollowing procedure as laid down under Section 81(4) of Tami l Nadu \nCoopertive Societies Act as well as Rule 104 of Tamil Nadu Cooperative \nSocieties Act, has submitted a report against the petiti oner. After receipt \nof the report, the first respondent without furnishing t he same to the \npetitioner  and  after  a  lapse  of  six  months,  initiated  Surc harge \nProceedings under Section 87 against the petitioner. The  petitioner has \nfiled Writ Petition in W.P.No.41290 of 2004, seeking to fur nish the copy \n2/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\nof the  enquiry report and the same was disposed of by directing the first \nrespondent to furnish the copy of the enquiry report to the petiti oner. \n3.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  submitted  that  without \nfurnishing the enquiry report under Section 81, the first  respondent has \npassed  surcharge  proceedings  under  Section  87,  vide \nNa.Ka.No.3963/2003 Ku.Na,  dated 25.08.2004, by fixing liabili ty on the \npetitioner to pay a sum of Rs.4.77 lakhs along with other  employees. The \npetitioner has preferred Statutory Appeal under Section  152 of Tamil \nNadu Cooperative Societies Act before the District and  Sessions Judge, \nVillupuram in C.M.A.No.47 of 2003 and he had not preferred Statutory \nAppeal under Section 87. But the District Court/Cooperat ive Tirbunal on \n17.12.2008 passed the final order as if the petitioner ha s challenged the \norder  passed  by  the  first  respondent  under  Section  87  sur charge \nproceedings and rejected the Appeal. Hence, the petitione r is before this \nCourt by way of this Writ Petition.\n4.   Learned  Counsel  for  the  first  respondent  has  filed  co unter \naffidavit  and  contended  that  the  enquiry  officer  has  obse rved  the \nprocedure as laid down under Section 81(4) of the Act an d Rule 104(6) \n3/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\nof the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act and submitt ed his report. It \nis also submitted that the enquiry officer has given su fficient opportunity \nto  the  petitioner  and  obtained  statement  prior  to  submi ssions  of  his \nreport.  The  first  respondent  based  the  enquiry  report  has  passed  the \nsurcharge order against the petitioner in 11 counts amounti ng to Rs.4.77 \nlakhs. It is further submitted that the petitioner had n ot approached the \nfirst respondent to furnish  a copy of the enquiry report an d straight away \napproached the High Court for furnishing a copy of the enqu iry report \nand as per orders dated 24.11.2004, copy of the enquiry repor t was also \nfurnished to the petitioner. Thereby, the contentions of t he petitioner are \nnot sustainable and also unacceptable.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents on record.\n6. During the course of the arguments, it is brought to  the notice of \nthis Court by the respondents that Full Bench this court consisting  of five \njudges,   in Writ Appeal No.1573 of 1998 , dated 29.09.2006,  has ruled \nthat  the  writ  petition  will  not  lie  against  the  society  i t  is  an \ninstrumentality of the State. The operative portion of t he Full Bench \nJudgement sited supra reads as under: \n4/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\n21.  From  the  above  discussion,  the  following \npropositions emerge:- \n“(i) If  a  particular  co-operative  society  can  be \ncharacterised as a  State  within the meaning of Articl e  \n12 of the Constitution (applying the tests evolved by the \nSupreme  Court  in  that  behalf),  it  would  also  be   an \nauthority  within the meaning and for the purpose of \nArticle 226 of the Constitution. In such a situation, an  \norder passed by a society in violation of the bye-laws  \ncan be corrected by way of writ petition. \n(ii) Applying the tests in Ajay Hasia it is held that the \nrespondent society carrying on banking business cannot \nbe termed as an instrumentality of the State within the \nmeaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.\n(iii) Even if a society cannot be characterised as a \nState   within  the  meaning  of  Article  12  of  the \nConstitution,  even  so  a  writ  would  lie  against  it  to \nenforce a statutory public duty cast upon the society.  In  \nsuch a case, it is unnecessary to go into the question \nwhether the society is being treated as a  person  or  an \nauthority   within  the  meaning  of  Article  226  of  the \nConstitution and what is material is the nature of the  \nstatutory duty placed upon it and the Court will enforce \n5/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\nsuch statutory public duty. Although it is not easy to \ndefine what a public function or public duty is, it can \nreasonably  said  that  such  functions  are similar  to or \nclosely related to those performable by the State in it s \nsovereign capacity. \n(iv) A  society,  which  is  not  a   State   would  not  \nnormally  be  amenable  to  the  writ  jurisdiction  under \nArticle  226  of  the  Constitution,  but  in  certain \ncircumstances, a writ may issue to such private bodies \nor persons as there may be statutory provisions which \nneed to  be complied  with  by all  concerned  including \nsocieties. If they violate such statutory provisions a writ \nwould be issued for compliance of those provisions. \n(v) Where a Special Officer is appointed in respect of a \nco-operative society which cannot be characterised as a \nState  a writ would lie when the case falls under Claus es \n(iii) and (iv) above.\n(vi) The  bye-laws  made  by  a  co-operative  society \nregistered under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies \nAct, 1983 do not have the force of law. Hence, where a  \nsociety cannot be characterised as a  State , the ser vice \nconditions  of  its  employees  governed  by  its  bye-laws \ncannot be enforced through a writ petition. \n6/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\n(vii) In  the  absence  of  special  circumstances,  the \nCourt will not ordinarily exercise power under Article \n226 of the Constitution of India when the Act provides \nfor an alternative remedy.\n(viii) The  decision  in  M.Thanikkachalam  v. \nMadhuranthagam  Agricultural  Co-operative  Society, \n2000 (4) CTC 556 is no longer good law, in view of the  \ndecision of the seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court \nin Pradeep Kumar Biswas case and the other  decisions  \nreferred to here before. \nThe reference is answered accordingly. Registry is \ndirected to place the paper before the appropriate be nch \nfor its disposal.”\n7.  The  respondent  society  is  not  an  instrumentality  of  t he  state \nwithin the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. Once the second \nrespondent is not an instrumentality of the State, the writ petiti on will not \nlie against the society.\n8.  In view of the above the Registry is directed  to c onvert the Writ \nPetition to Civil Revision Petition and place it before appro priate  bench \n7/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.9282 of 2009\nDr.D.NAGARJUN, J.\njai\nafter obtaining the orders from My Lord The Hon'ble Chie f Justice.

    "summary": "The petition, filed by the legal representatives of the deceased S. Vetrivel, sought a writ of mandamus directing the Cooperative Society and its registrars to pay the petitioner’s retirement benefits—gratuity, EPF, earned and unearned leave encashment, six months’ salary and subsistence allowance. The petitioner had been appointed Secretary of the Muthandikuppam Primary Agricultural Co‑operative Credit Society in 1975 and was terminated on 26‑06‑2009 following disciplinary proceedings under Section 81 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, which also resulted in a surcharge of Rs 5,57,050. The petitioner contended that dismissal does not extinguish his right to statutory benefits, and that any loss could be adjusted against those benefits. The respondents argued that the termination and criminal proceedings barred payment. The Court, relying on earlier Madras High Court decisions (WP(MD) Nos. 979, 980 of 2016 and WP(MD) No. 10329 of 2019), held that dismissal does not preclude entitlement to gratuity, EPF, and leave encashment, though the society may deduct any proven loss. Accordingly, the Court directed the respondents to disburse the benefits within eight weeks, allowing deductions for loss, and disposed of the petition without costs.",
    "facts": "The first petitioner was appointed Secretary of the Muthandikuppam Primary Agricultural Co‑operative Credit Society on 01‑09‑1975. In 2007 an inquiry under Section 81 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act was initiated for alleged irregularities in granting jewel loans. A surcharge of Rs 5,57,050 was imposed on 02‑04‑2009. The disciplinary proceedings concluded with the petitioner’s termination on 26‑06‑2009. No retirement benefits were paid thereafter. A criminal case (C.C.No.46 of 2009) was later disposed, and the petitioner was placed under probation. The petitioner’s family filed a writ petition seeking gratuity, EPF, leave encashment, six months’ salary and subsistence allowance.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that statutory retirement benefits accrue irrespective of dismissal and that the society may only adjust amounts against any proven loss. They cited earlier Madras High Court orders directing payment of such benefits even to dismissed employees. Respondents contended that the termination and pending criminal liability justified withholding benefits and that the loss amount should be recovered from the petitioner’s dues.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the statutory scheme governing cooperative societies and noted that the entitlement to gratuity, EPF and leave encashment is based on service rendered, not on the manner of termination. It relied on WP(MD) Nos. 979 and 980 (2016) and WP(MD) No. 10329 (2019), which held that dismissal does not extinguish benefit rights, though societies may deduct amounts proven to be losses. The Court therefore ordered payment of all benefits within eight weeks, permitting deduction of the Rs 5,57,050 loss if already accounted for during criminal proceedings.",

During  his  service,  an  enqu iry  under \nSection 81 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act h as been initiated \nagainst the Petitioner, on the order of the second Respondent  in year 2007, in \nrespect of certain irregularities committed by the f irst Petitioner and another \nemployee,  in  giving  jewel  loan.   The  second  Respondent  has  al so  passed \nsurcharge order on 02.04.2009 against the first Petitioner and another employee \nof the said society for recovery of Rs.5,57,050/-. After i nitiation of disciplinary \nproceedings, the first Petitioner was found guilty and he was terminated from \nservice on 26.06.2009 and the Respondent has not disbursed a ny monetary \nbenefits of the first Petitioner, so far.  \n3.It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitio ners that even a \ncriminal case has arisen, in view of the above allegations in C.C.No.46 of 2009 \nand  it  has  been  disposed  and  the  first  Petitioner  has  bee n  kept  under  the \nsupervision of Probation Officer.   \n4.Learned counsel for the Petitioners attracted the attent ion of this Court \nto  the  order  passed  by  this  Court  in  W.P.(MD).No.10329  of  201 9  dated \n3/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.2 of 2020\n18.02.2019, wherein it was held as follows:\n“3.The learned counsel submitted that this Court had, in a \nnumber of cases, directed the authorities to settle such benefits, \neven if an employee suffered a dismissal order and one s uch a \ncase is WP(MD).Nos.979 and 980 of 2016, wherein this C ourt \nhad, by order dated 19.01.2016, issued directions as stated ab ove \nand such a submission is not seriously objected to, by  the learned \nGovernment Advocate.\n4.In view of the decision cited supra, this Court directs  the  \nrespondents  to  disburse  Gratuity,  General  Provident  Fund , \nSpecial  Provident  Fund  and  Encashment  of  Earned  and \nUnearned leave to Petitioner, which he is entitled to, wi thin a  \nperiod of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a co py of this \norder.”\n5.Heard the learned counsel appearing on either sides and perused the \navailable records.\n6.It is learnt that no  appeal  has been preferred against  the judgment \npassed in C.C.No.46 of 2009 dated 17.02.2014.  The fact that the first Pet itioner \nwas placed under the supervision of the Probation Officer , as the guilt against \nthe first Petitioner has been proved, but lenience has b een shown in view of \ncertain submissions made by the first Petitioner that he is th e first time offender. \n4/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.2 of 2020\nEven though the first Petitioner might not be entitled to get gratuity, the first \nPetitioner is very much entitled to get other benefits li ke EPF, encashment of \nEarned Leave and Unearned Leave on private affairs.  \n7.It is also claimed by the Petitioners that the first  Petitioner's salary for \nsix months was withheld and the same should be paid to him.

The petitioner argued that the COVID‑19 lockdown prevented payment of the lease/franchise fees and that representations dated 18‑Nov‑2021 and 10‑Nov‑2021 requesting waiver had not been acted upon. The respondents conceded that the representations would be considered in accordance with law and that appropriate orders would be passed. The Court, without delving into the merits, directed the respondents to consider the petitioner’s representations and to pass orders within twelve weeks of receipt of the order. Consequently, both writ petitions were disposed of without costs. The judgment reflects the Court’s procedural intervention to ensure administrative consideration of the petitioner’s request, rather than adjudicating the substantive claim for waiver.",
    "facts": "MGM Entertainments entered into 15‑year lease agreements with the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. for operating \"Hotel Tamilnadu\" at Coonoor and Ranipet. Due to the COVID‑19 lockdown, the petitioner could not pay the lease/franchise fees for the 15th year and the extended period. The petitioner sent representations on 18‑Nov‑2021 and 10‑Nov‑2021 requesting a waiver of the outstanding amounts, but no order was issued by the respondents.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner: The lockdown constituted a force majeure event preventing payment; the petitioner had timely represented for a waiver and sought judicial direction to compel the respondents to consider and grant the waiver. Respondents: Acknowledged receipt of the representations and agreed to consider them in accordance with law, without contesting the substantive merit of the waiver request.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court refrained from examining the substantive merits of the waiver claim, noting that the respondents had already indicated they would consider the petitioner’s representations as per law. Accordingly, the Court issued a procedural direction for the respondents to act on the representations within twelve weeks, thereby disposing of the writ petitions.",

While  being  so,  due  to\nlockdown, the petitioner was unable to pay the lease/franchise\nfee as demanded by the respondents.

    "summary": "The appeal (Appeal Suit No.312 of 2011) challenges a decree dated 17‑12‑2009 of the City Civil Court, Chennai, which granted partition of two adjoining properties (Schedule A – 954 sq ft and Schedule B – 500 sq ft) and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs a one‑seventh share of rental receipts. The plaintiffs, heirs of Lakshmi (second daughter of the deceased P. Ganesan), claim a one‑seventh interest in both properties and the corresponding mesne profits. The defendants rely on a 1992 Will in favour of the first defendant (G. Murugesan) and the mother, and a 1996 Settlement Deed in favour of the second defendant, asserting that these instruments vest full ownership in them, rendering the partition suit untenable. The trial court, after evaluating oral testimony and documentary evidence (sale deeds, settlement deeds, Will, rent ledgers), held that the settlement deed transferred only half of Schedule A to the plaintiffs, leaving the remaining half to the first defendant, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to their one‑seventh share and rental proceeds. The appellant contends the trial court mis‑appreciated the documents and facts. The High Court, after hearing counsel, examined the validity of the Will versus the settlement deed, the extent of the transferred interests, and the right to mesne profits, ultimately dismissing the appeal and upholding the lower court’s decree.",
    "facts": "P. Ganesan purchased two properties (Schedule A: 954 sq ft; Schedule B: 500 sq ft). He executed a settlement deed (16‑06‑1994) granting half of Schedule A (475.25 sq ft) to his second daughter Lakshmi. He also executed a Will (27‑08‑1992) bequeathing the entire Schedule A to G. Murugesan and Lakshmi jointly. After Lakshmi’s death (20‑04‑2007) and P. Ganesan’s death (26‑12‑2007), the plaintiffs (Lakshmi’s heirs) claimed a one‑seventh share in both properties and the corresponding rental income. Defendants collected rents from tenants since 01‑01‑2008. The trial court decreed partition and rental share in favour of the plaintiffs.",
    "arguments": "Plaintiffs argued that the settlement deed transferred only a half‑share to their mother, leaving the remaining half to be shared with the first defendant under the Will, thus entitling them to a one‑seventh interest and mesne profits. First defendant relied on the Will, asserting full ownership of the entire Schedule A, and sought dismissal. Second defendant relied on a separate settlement deed (23‑02‑1996) for Schedule B, claiming exclusive possession and right to collect rent.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court examined the chronology of the Will (1992) and the settlement deed (1994). It held that the settlement deed superseded the Will to the extent of the half‑share expressly conveyed to Lakshmi, making that portion exclusive property of the plaintiffs. The balance of Schedule A remained with the first defendant by virtue of the Will. Consequently, the plaintiffs were entitled to a one‑seventh share of the whole property and the corresponding rental income. The second defendant’s claim over Schedule B was similarly limited, and the plaintiffs’ entitlement to mesne profits was affirmed.",

Second defendant in the suit is the appellant herein and\nthe plaintiffs in the suit are the respondents 1 to 3 herein.\n3. Suit was one for partition of the Plaint 'A' and 'B'\nSchedule properties by dividing the same by metes and bounds\ninto seven equal shares and deliver possession of one such share\nto the plaintiffs; for a direction to the defendants 1 and 2 to\nrender accounts in respect of the rental collection from the\nPlaint 'A' and 'B' Schedule properties from 01.01.2008 and\nfurther  to  direct  the  defendants  1  and  2  to  pay  to  the\nplaintiffs 1/7th share from the rental collection and for costs.\n4. The case of the respondents/plaintiffs, as per the\nplaint, was as under : \n4.1. One late P.Ganesan, grandfather of the plaintiffs, had\nmarried one Manickammal and they had seven children. Defendants\n1 and 2 are the sons and  defendants 3 to 5 are the daughters of\nthe said P.Ganesan.  Lakshmi, mother of plaintiffs, is the\nsecond  daughter  of  P.Ganesan  and  Muthuvalli,  mother  of\ndefendants 6 and 7, is the first daughter of P.Ganesan.  \n4.2. P.Ganesan purchased the suit property bearing Old Door\nNo.16, corresponding New Door No.37, Azeez Mulk 3rd Street,\nThousand Lights, Chennai-6, measuring to an extent of 954 sq.ft.\nby way of a Sale Deed, dated 24.04.1989, registered as document\nNo.352/1989  on  the  file  of  Sub-Registrar,  Thousand  Lights,\nChennai.  P.Ganesan, during his lifetime,  executed a settlement\ndeed, dated 16.06.1994, registered as document No.458/1994 on\nthe file of Sub-Registrar, Thousand Lights, Chennai, in favour\nof his second daughter, namely, Lakshmi, who is the mother of\nplaintiffs, in respect of half portion of the above property\nmeasuring to an extent of 475.25 sq.ft and the remaining extent\nof  475.25  was  retained  by  P.Ganesan,  which  is  more  fully\ndescribed in Plaint  'A'  Schedule. \n4.3. P.Ganesan purchased another immovable property bearing\nOld Door No.18 and New Door No.3, in Azeez Mulk 4th Street,\nThousand Lights Chennai-6, measuring to an extent of 500 sq.ft.,\nby way of a Sale Deed, dated 08.05.1974, registered as document\nNo.719/1974 on the file of Sub Registrar, Thousand Lights,\nChennai, from one Kothandam and three others, which is set out\nin Plaint 'B' Schedule.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n4.4. Lakshmi, mother of the plaintiffs, died on 20.04.2007,\nleaving behind the plaintiffs and one K.Vijayakumar as her\nheirs. The said Vijayakumar died as a bachelor on 27.12.2007.\nP.Ganesan died on 26.12.2007, leaving behind his sons, daughters\nand grandchildren, as his heirs.  \n4.5. P.Ganesan had let out a portion of the ground and first\nfloor in the Plaint 'A' Schedule property to G.T. Electronics on\na monthly rent of Rs.6000/-.  First defendant, who is in\noccupation of a portion of Plaint 'A'  Schedule property, is\ncollecting the monthly rent from the tenant from 01.01.2008.\nP.Ganesan had also let out a portion in the ground floor of the\nPlaint 'B' Schedule property to a Xerox Machine Service Centre\non a monthly rent of Rs.6000/- along with a portion in first\nfloor in Plaint 'B' Schedule property to Zonecom on a monthly\nrent of Rs.4000/-. Second defendant, who is in occupation of\nPlaint 'B' Schedule property is collecting the rent of Rs.6000/-\nplus Rs.4000/- from the tenants from 01.01.2008.\n4.6. Plaintiffs are the legal heirs of Lakshmi, who is one\nof the daughters of late P.Ganesan, and are entitled to 1/7th\nshare in Plaint 'A' and 'B' Schedule properties. Defendants are\nnot agreeable for amicable partition of the suit properties.\nLegal notices, dated 30.01.2008 and 11.02.2008, were sent to the\ndefendants, calling upon them to effect partition of Plaint 'A'\nand  'B'  Schedule  properties,  but,  there  was  no  reply.\nDefendants 1 and 2 are collecting rents from the tenants and the\nplaintiffs are entitled to 1/7th share in the rentals.  Hence,\nthe suit for partition of the suit properties and for payment of\n1/7th share from the rental collection and for costs.\n5. The case of the appellant/defendants, in the written\nstatement, was as follows :\n5.1. First defendant contested the suit by filing a written\nstatement, contending, inter alia, that a Will was executed by\nthe  deceased  P.Ganesan  on  27.08.1992,  by  which  Plaint  'A'\nSchedule  property  was  bequeathed  in  favour  of  the  first\ndefendant; that the total extent of 954 sq.ft. of the Plaint 'A'\nSchedule property was the subject matter of the Will, dated\n27.08.1992; Lakshmi and her husband Kuppuswamy prevailed upon\nP.Ganesan and got the settlement deed executed in respect of\nhalf share and the plaintiffs' mother became the owner of the\nproperty;  that  the  Will  was  duly  probated;  the  suit  for\npartition was not maintainable; the first defendant was entitled\nto collect the rents and profits from the Plaint 'A' Schedule\nproperty and, accordingly, he prayed for dismissal of the suit.  \n5.2. Second defendant resisted the suit by filing a written\nstatement,  stating  that  P.Ganesan  settled  the  Plaint  'B'\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nSchedule property to the second defendant in and by a Settlement\nDeed, dated 23.02.1996; the settlement deed was acted upon; the\nsecond defendant had been in possession and enjoyment of the 'B'\nSchedule property; at the time of settlement deed, there was a\nhouse with Madras terrace; after the execution of the settlement\ndeed, the second defendant demolished the superstructure that\nexisted then and constructed a building with a ground and two\nfloors in the year 1997; the plaintiffs were fully aware of the\ndemolition and new construction; necessary mutation was made in\nthe Government records; second defendant was in possession of\nthe Plaint 'B' Schedule property; second defendant had got every\nright to let out the property and collect rent from the tenants;\nthe plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief; the suit for\npartition was not maintainable and, accordingly, he prayed for\ndismissal of the suit.  \n6. On the above pleadings, the trial Court framed the\nfollowing  issues for trial :\n(1) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to 1/7th\nshare in 'A' and 'B' Schedule properties, as prayed\nfor ?\n(2) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the\nmesne profits ?\n(3) Whether the 1st and 2nd defendants become the\nowners of the 'A' and 'B' Schedule properties by virtue\nof the Will, dated 27.08.1992, and the Settlement Deed,\ndated 23.02.1996, respectively ?\n(4) To what other reliefs, the plaintiffs are\nentitled ?\n7.  During  the  course  of  trial,  on  behalf  of  the\nrespondents/plaintiffs, two witnesses were examined as P.Ws.1\nand 2 and documents Exs.A-1 to A-11 were marked. On the side of\nappellant/defendants, two witnesses were examined as D.Ws.1 and\n2 and documents Exs.B-1 to B-11 were marked.\n8. The trial Court, considering the evidence, both oral and\ndocumentary,  decreed  the  suit  as  prayed  for,  with  costs.\nAggrieved over the same, this Appeal Suit is filed, at the\ninstance of the second defendant.\n9. Learned counsel for the appellant would contend that the\ntrial Court has failed to appreciate the matter from proper\nperspective,  which  led  to  the  suit  being  decreed,  and,\ntherefore, the judgment and the decree passed by the trial Court\nare liable to be set aside. According to him, the trial Court\nhas  grossly  erred  in  allowing  the  claim  of  the\nrespondents/plaintiffs  on  misinterpretation  of  facts  and\nevidence and, therefore, the claim is liable to be rejected.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n10. Though respondents have been served and their names have\nalso been printed in the Cause List, none appeared on their\nbehalf. Therefore, this Court proceeds to decide the matter on\nmerit, without adjourning the matter any further, as the appeal\nis of the year 2011, which is over  a decade old.\n \n11. I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and\nalso gone through the records.\n12. The point that arises for consideration in this appeal\nis,  whether  the  respondents/plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the\ndecree, as granted by the trial Court?\n13. The suit schedule property was originally owned by late\nP.Ganesan, who is the father of the appellant and grandfather of\nrespondents 1 to 3 and the same is not in dispute.  The only\ncontroversy is, who is entitled to which property and to what\nextent, among the legal heirs of P.Ganesan, who is no more.\n14. The property bearing Old Door No.16, corresponding New\nDoor No.37, Azeez Mulk, 3rd Street, Thousand Lights, Chennai-6,\nmeasuring an  extent of 954 sq.ft. was purchased by P.Ganesan by\nway of a Sale Deed, dated 24.04.1989, registered as document\nNo.352/1989  on  the  file  of  Sub-Registrar,  Thousand  Lights,\nChennai. Ganesan, during his lifetime,  executed a Settlement\nDeed, dated 16.06.1994, registered as document No.458/1994 on\nthe file of Sub-Registrar, Thousand Lights, Chennai, in favour\nof his second daughter, namely, Lakshmi, who is the mother of\nplaintiffs, in respect of half portion of the above property\nmeasuring to an extent of 475.25 sq.ft., which is not in\ndispute. The remaining extent of 475.25 was retained by Ganesan,\nwhich is the Plaint  'A' Schedule property, now in dispute and\nin which the respondents/plaintiffs sought 1/7th share. In this\nregard, the stand of the first defendant before the trial Court\nwas that his father P.Ganesan executed a Will, Ex.B-1, on\n27.08.1992 in his favour for the total extent of 954 sq.ft. of\nthe Plaint 'A' Schedule property.  On perusal of the said\ndocument Ex.B-1, what comes to be known is that the P.Ganesan\nexecuted the said Will for the entire extent of 954 sq.ft. in\nfavour of G.Murugesan, who is the first defendant, and Lakshmi,\nmother of respondents/plaintiffs, jointly. Though the said Will\nwas executed by P.Ganesan in favour of both the first defendant\nand the mother of plaintiffs on 27.08.1992 for the entire\nproperty,  subsequently,  the  very  same  executant,  namely,\nP.Ganesan executed a Settlement Deed, Ex.B-2, dated 16.06.1994,\nin favour of Lakshmi, mother of the plaintiffs, for an extent of\n475.25 sq.ft., out of the total extent of 954 sq.ft.  Therefore,\nthat half portion of 475.25 sq.ft. shall remain the exclusive\nproperty of the plaintiffs and the remaining half portion of\n475.25  sq.ft.  remains  the  absolute  property  of  the  first\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\ndefendant by virtue of Ex.B-1, Will.  It is not the case of the\nfirst defendant that the entire extent of 954 sq.ft. belongs to\nhim by virtue of Ex.B-1, Will. His only claim is that since half\nportion in 954 sq.ft. has devolved on respondents /plaintiffs by\nvirtue  of  Ex.B-2,  Settlement  Deed,  the  remaining  portion\ndevolves on him by virtue of Ex.B-1, Will. The trial Court\ndismissed the said claim on the ground that the fir",

    "summary": "The petitioners—Lakshmi and two minors, Akash and Harish—filed a review application (Rev. Aplc. No.41 of 2022) before the Madras High Court, seeking to set aside the judgment dated 09 July 2021 in S.A. No.50 of 2009. The review was sought on four grounds: alleged adverse possession by respondents, non‑challenge to cancellation of a settlement deed, the majority of the second appellant at the time of the original decree, and alleged non‑appreciation of evidence of P.W.2 and non‑joinder of a witness. The Court examined the applicability of Order XLVII Rule 1 of the CPC, which permits review only on the basis of an error apparent on the face of the record, discovery of new and important matter, or evidence that could not have been known despite due diligence. The Court held that the petitioners' grounds were essentially matters that should have been raised during the second appeal and did not fall within the limited scope of a review. Consequently, the review application was dismissed without costs. The judgment underscores the restrictive nature of review proceedings and the necessity for parties to raise substantive objections at the appropriate stage of appeal.",
    "facts": "Petitioners filed a review application against the High Court's judgment in S.A. No.50 of 2009, which stemmed from a second appeal (section 100 CPC) against a decree in A.S. No.19 of 2006, itself reversing an earlier decree in O.S. No.292 of 2003. The review sought to overturn the earlier judgment on grounds relating to adverse possession, settlement deed cancellation, majority of a minor appellant, and alleged evidentiary oversights.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that (a) respondents had adverse possession and thus could not seek declaration, (b) the settlement deed cancellation was unchallenged making the suit untenable, (c) the second appellant had attained majority at the time of the original decree, and (d) the court failed to properly consider P.W.2's evidence and omitted a crucial witness, Muthu. The respondents contended that these issues were either already decided or should have been raised during the second appeal, not in a review.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the grounds raised do not satisfy the criteria for review under Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. No error apparent on the face of the record, no new and important matter, and no evidence undiscovered despite due diligence were demonstrated. The matters raised are essentially grounds for a fresh appeal, not for review. Hence, the review application was dismissed.",

The\ngrounds on which the review is sought for are as follows:\n(a)The plaintiffs who are respondents 1 and 2 in\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nthe review application have pleaded adverse possession\nand was therefore not entitled to seek declaration.\n(b)The  plaintiffs  have  not  challenged  the\ncancellation of the settlement deed and therefore the\nsuit is not maintainable.\n(c)The 2nd appellant had attained majority even on\nthe date of the original decree and the act of not\ndischarging the guardian and recording the majority\nhas to be reconsidered. \n(d)The evidence of P.W.2 has not been analysed and\nappreciated properly by this Court and the non joinder\nof one, Muthu is fatal to the suit.\n2. A mere perusal of the above grounds would clearly show\nthat the same does not come within the grounds for seeking a\nreview of the Judgement as per Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of\nCivil Procedure.  The petitioners had not made out if there is\nan error apparent on the face of the record or they have\ndiscovered a new and important matter or the evidence which\ndespite due diligence was not within their knowledge and neither\nas they shown any other sufficient reasons for seeking review of\nthe Judgement in S.A.No.50 of 2009.  That apart these are\nmatters which ought to have been raised at the time of argument\nof the Second Appeal.  \n3. Since the scope of interference is very limited in a\nreview application and as the grounds raised by the petitioners\nfor review is merely grounds for filing further appeal, this\nCourt is not inclined to entertain the review, accordingly, the\nReview Application is dismissed.  No costs.  \n        \n                          \n                                 Sd/-\n     Assistant Registrar(CS VII)\n//True Copy//\n     Sub Assistant Registrar\nkan                       \nTo\n1.

Pradeep in STC No.46 of 2016 for conviction under NI Act s.138 and a compensation order under Cr.P.C. s.357(3). The conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Fast‑Track Judicial Magistrate, Coonoor (20‑04‑2018) and later by the Sessions Judge, Nilgiris (31‑03‑2022). The petitioner filed a Criminal Revision Petition challenging both conviction and sentence, contending substantial grounds for relief. The learned counsel argued that the revision raises serious questions warranting suspension of the sentence. The High Court, after reviewing the material, found merit in the revision and ordered suspension of the substantive imprisonment, directing the petitioner to surrender to the trial court, execute a bail bond of Rs.10,000, and comply with identification requirements. The order also permits the petitioner’s release on bail pending final disposal of the revision.

The prosecution did not oppose the suspension, and the court noted the need to protect the petitioner’s liberty while the revision is pending.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court exercised its discretion under s.397 r/w s.439 Cr.P.C., observing that the revision petition contains substantial grounds warranting detailed appraisal.

The appellant sought a higher compensation for the minor's education and future medical expenses. The respondents, Kuppan and United India Insurance Co. Ltd., contested the award but agreed to settle the matter through a National Lok Adalat held on 9 September 2023, presided over by Justice V. Lakshminarayanan and two members. After mediation, the parties settled on an additional payment of Rs.3,00,000 over and above the tribunal award, totaling Rs.5,60,000. The appellant’s counsel certified that the settlement serves the minor’s interests and causes no prejudice. The court directed the respondent to deposit the agreed sum within eight weeks, ordered the transfer of funds via RTGS/NEFT, and directed the refund of court fees under the Court Fees Act.

    "summary": "The appeal (AS No.100 of 2012) filed by the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tiruvannamalai, under Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act seeks to set aside the decree dated 28‑04‑2006 (LAOP No.82 of 1995) that enhanced compensation to claimants for land acquired under Section 4(1) of the Act. The claimants, seven persons, owned parcels in survey Nos.84/3D1 and 86/2B,A1 totaling about 1.15 hectares. The acquisition officer initially fixed a market value of Rs.21,500 per acre, but the referral court, applying Section 18(1), re‑fixed compensation at Rs.2,000 per cent after examining evidence (Ex.C1, Ex.C2, CW1, CW2, RW1, Ex.R1‑Ex.R11). The court noted that the acquisition officer failed to consider prevailing market values and relied on prior judgments (LAOP No.7 of 1986) and comparable sales (Rs.6 per sq.ft.). The High Court held that the referral court correctly applied legal principles, found no infirmity in the decree, and dismissed the appeal, confirming the enhanced compensation. No costs were awarded.",
    "facts": "The government acquired land in Tiruvannamalai for a market committee. The acquisition officer fixed a market value of Rs.21,500 per acre. Claimants filed petitions for enhanced compensation. The referral court, under Section 18(1), re‑evaluated the market value, considering prior award (LAOP No.7 of 1986) and a comparable sale (Rs.6 per sq.ft.), and fixed compensation at Rs.2,000 per cent. The appellant challenged this enhanced award.",
    "arguments": "Appellant argued that the acquisition officer’s original valuation was correct and that the referral court erred in re‑fixing compensation. Respondents contended that the acquisition officer ignored prevailing market values and that the referral court rightly enhanced compensation based on comparable transactions and established case law.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the acquisition officer failed to consider the prevailing market value at the time of acquisition, contrary to established jurisprudence of this Court and the Supreme Court. The referral court’s reliance on comparable sales and prior judgments was proper. No infirmity or illegality was found in the decree, leading to its confirmation and dismissal of the appeal.",

The appellant is the Land Acquisition Officer and t he respondents \nare the claimants. The claimants' land comprised in survey No.84/3D1 to an \nextent  of  0.29.0  hectares  belonged  to  claimants  No.1  to  3  and  the  land \ncomprised in survey No.86 /2B,A1 to an extent of 0.8 5.5 hectares belonged to \nclaimants No.5 to 8. In order to acquire the said lands , Section 4(1) of the Land \nAcquisition Act notification was published in the villa ge on 18.04.1993 for the \npurpose of constructing Market Committee.  After compl etion of acquisition \nproceedings,  the  Acquisition  Officer  passed  an  award  the reby  re-fixed  the \nmarket value of the property as Rs.21,500/- per acre.  It was referred under \nSection 18(1) of Land Acquisition Act. The claimants filed claim petition for \nenhancement of compensation before the referral court. \n2/6\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nAS.No.100 of 2012\n3. The claimants marked Ex.C1 and C2 and they had exami ned CW1 \nand CW2. The appellant had examined RW1 and marked Ex .R1 to Ex.R11. On \nperusal of oral and documentary evidence, the referral c ourt fixed at Rs.2000/- \nper cent. \n4. On perusal of records revealed that the Acquisition Of ficer failed to \nconsider the prevailing market value of the property  at the time of acquisition. \nTherefore, the Acquisition Officer failed to fix the correct value of the acquired \nlands in accordance with the principles of law laid do wn by this Court as well \nas the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Therefore, the r eferral court awarded \ncompensation  by  considering  the  market  value  of the  a cquired  lands.  The \nclaimants marked Ex.C1 and C2. Ex.C1 is the award pa ssed in LAOP.No.7 of \n1986 thereby held that in respect of the land acquir ed in survey No.91/1A3D2. \nThe said judgment was pronounced on 01.10.1986. In the present acquisition \nproceedings, Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act no tification was issued \nion 21.01.1984. The acquired properties are also lo cated just opposite to the \nlands which are acquired in the present case. In th e said case, considering the \nmarket value of the land and fixed price at Rs.1306 .80/- per cent. On perusal of \n3/6\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nAS.No.100 of 2012\nEx.C2, it is the sale deed in respect of the land comp rised in survey No.90/1A \nto an extent of 3854 sq.ft. sold on 04.06.1990 for the sale consideration of \nRs.23,000/- and the square feet comes to Rs.6/-. The  acquired property is also \nsituated  just  opposite to the said  property.  Therefor e, considering both  the \ndocuments, the referral court rightly enhanced the compen sation and thereby \nfixed at Rs.2,000/- per cent with other benefits. Hence , this Court finds no \ninfirmity or illegality in the decree passed by the refe rral court and this appeal \nsuit is liable to be dismissed.\n5. Accordingly, this appeal suit is dismissed and the decree  passed in \nLAOP.No.82  of  1995  dated  28.04.2006  on  the  file  of  the  District \nJudge(Training) Additional Subordinate Judge-II, Tiruvann amalai is confirmed. \nThere shall be no order as to costs.\n \n14.12.2023\nIndex : Yes / No \nInternet : Yes / No\nSpeaking order /Non-speaking order\nlok\n \n4/6\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nAS.No.100 of 2012\nTo\n \n1.The District Judge(Training) \n   Additional Subordinate Judge-II, \n   Tiruvannamalai.                     \n2.Section Officer,\n   V .R.Section,\n   High Court of Madras \n \n \n \n5/6\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nAS.No.100 of 2012\nG.K.ILANTHIRAIYAN, J.\n \nlok \n \n \nAS.No.100 of 2012\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14.12.2023\n \n6/6\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis",

    "summary": "The petitioner, A. Sivasami, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a mandamus directing the District Collector, the Commissioner of Panchayat Union, and the Block Development Officer to stop the construction of a public toilet adjacent to his 83‑cent agricultural plot (S.No.170/2A, Thirumannur Village, Salem). The petitioner alleged that the toilet blocked access to his land and that the authorities had ignored his representation dated 15‑06‑2020 and a pre‑contempt notice dated 20‑08‑2020. The respondents contended that the petitioner had not clarified the nature of the adjoining land and that the petition was an improper exercise of contempt jurisdiction, rendering it non‑maintainable. The Court noted that the respondents had failed to respond to a communication from the Divisional Engineer, Highways, dated 28‑07‑2020, which indicated no permission was granted for the toilet. However, the Court held that the petitioner had already initiated contempt proceedings for wilful disobedience of the earlier order dated 24‑07‑2020 in WP‑No.9604/2020, making the present writ petition an unnecessary duplication. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed, the petitioner was directed to pursue remedies under the Contempt of Courts Act, and no costs were awarded.",
    "facts": "The petitioner owns agricultural land (S.No.170/2A) in Thirumannur Village. A public toilet was being constructed on the road margin adjacent to his plot, allegedly obstructing access. He submitted a representation on 15‑06‑2020 requesting the authorities to consider his objection. The Single Bench ordered the first respondent to act on the representation within two weeks (order dated 24‑07‑2020). The respondents failed to comply, and the petitioner issued a pre‑contempt notice on 20‑08‑2020. He also cited a communication from the Divisional Engineer, Highways, dated 28‑07‑2020, stating that no permission was granted for the toilet near KM25/2. The petitioner filed the present writ petition seeking a mandamus to stop the construction.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner: Asserted that the construction infringed his property rights, blocked agricultural access, and that the authorities had wilfully ignored his representation and the pre‑contempt notice. He relied on the earlier order and the Highways Engineer’s communication to argue that the toilet was unauthorized. Respondents: Argued that the petitioner had not clarified the exact nature of the adjoining land, that the contempt jurisdiction was being misused, and that the writ petition was therefore non‑maintainable.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the petitioner had already initiated contempt proceedings for the wilful disobedience of the 24‑07‑2020 order in WP‑No.9604/2020. Since the contempt remedy was pending, the Court deemed the present writ petition an unnecessary and duplicative exercise. While noting the respondents' failure to respond to the Highways Engineer’s communication, the Court held that the appropriate avenue for redress was the contempt petition, not a fresh writ. Accordingly, the writ petition was closed without costs.",

    "summary": "The petition (Crl.M.P.No.20 of 2023) filed by Kabilan under Section 397(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code seeks suspension of a sentence imposed by the Executive Magistrate and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar, in M.P.No.18 of 2022 dated 11‑11‑2022, and release on bail pending the disposal of the revision case. The petitioner had earlier executed a bond which the first respondent later cancelled, alleging breach of its terms and ordering detention. Both sides were heard. The bench noted that numerous similar orders have been referred to it, raising a larger question on the statutory power of Executive Magistrates to impose imprisonment and fine. Relying on the limited jurisdiction conferred by the CrPC, the court inclined to suspend the order of detention and release the petitioner on bail, subject to conditions: execution of a fresh bond of Rs.10,000 before the Superintendent of Central Jail, Puzhal, regular appearance before the second respondent police officer every Friday, and release if no further detention is required in other proceedings. The order reflects the court’s view that the Executive Magistrate exceeded its authority in imposing custodial punishment and that the petitioner is entitled to bail pending the outcome of the revision. The judgment thus grants the relief sought, suspending the sentence and directing release on bail.",
    "facts": "Kabilan was sentenced by the Executive Magistrate and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar, in M.P.No.18 of 2022 on 11‑11‑2022. He executed a bond as part of the sentence. The first respondent later cancelled the bond, alleging its breach, and ordered Kabilan’s detention. Kabilan filed a petition under Section 397(1) CrPC seeking suspension of the sentence and bail pending the revision of the case.",
    "arguments": "The petitioner argued that the Executive Magistrate exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing imprisonment and that the cancellation of the bond was unlawful. The respondents contended that the petitioner violated bond conditions, justifying detention. Both sides presented statutory interpretations of the powers of Executive Magistrates under the CrPC.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The bench observed that Executive Magistrates have limited powers under the CrPC, primarily to impose fines and short-term imprisonment, not extended custodial sentences. The cancellation of the bond without proper authority was deemed beyond the magistrate’s jurisdiction. Consequently, the court found merit in suspending the detention and granting bail, subject to conditions ensuring compliance and safeguarding public interest.",

The reliefs sought included restraining the defendants from using the mark or any deceptively similar mark, surrendering and destroying infringing labels, accounting for profits, and payment of damages and costs. The suit was filed under Order IV Rule 1 of the Original Side Rules and Sections 105 and 106 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. During the hearing, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Madhan Babu, informed the court that the plaintiff had instructed him to withdraw the suit. The court recorded the withdrawal, dismissed the suit as withdrawn, and granted the plaintiff liberty to sue again if a subsequent cause of action arises. No costs were awarded.

    "summary": "In C.S.No.1364 of 1995, S. Visalakshi Ammal filed a civil suit under Order IV Rule 1 read with Order VII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking administration, partition, and accounting of the estates of the deceased Devasenambal Ammal and T.M.P. Devasenambal Ammal. The plaintiff sought a decree directing the division of properties into six shares, appointment of an administrator, rendering of true accounts by several defendants, and various ancillary reliefs including the appointment of a receiver and commissioner. The suit listed 29 respondents, many of whom were deceased heirs or trustees of various temples and charitable institutions. On 18 October 2023, the matter was listed for hearing, but no counsel appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. The court, after noting the absence of any representation, ordered the suit to be posted for dismissal on 19 October 2023. The judgment affirmed dismissal for non‑prosecution, with no costs awarded. No substantive arguments or evidentiary material were considered, and the court relied solely on procedural rules governing abandonment of a suit due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute.",
    "facts": "The plaintiff, S. Visalakshi Ammal, claimed entitlement to a share of the estates left by the deceased Devasenambal Ammal and T.M.P. Devasenambal Ammal. She sought a decree directing the administration, valuation, partition into six equal shares, and delivery of one share to herself, along with orders for accounting, payment of dues, joint possession of certain charitable properties, and appointment of a receiver and commissioner. The suit named 29 respondents, including deceased heirs, temple trustees, and executive officers, many of whom were added through subsequent orders. The plaintiff did not appear in court on the scheduled hearing date.",
    "arguments": "No arguments were presented as the plaintiff failed to appear or be represented at the hearing. Consequently, the court could not consider any substantive contentions from either side.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court applied Order IV Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, which permits dismissal of a suit for non‑prosecution when the plaintiff does not appear or present any evidence. Since there was no representation for the plaintiff on 18 October 2023 and none appeared subsequently, the suit was dismissed for non‑prosecution. No costs were awarded as the dismissal was procedural.",
    "key_legal_points": [
      "A civil suit may be dismissed for non‑prosecution under Order IV Rule 1 of the CPC.",
      "Absence of the plaintiff or his counsel at a scheduled hearing constitutes abandonment of the suit.",
      "No costs are awarded when dismissal is solely on procedural grounds of non‑appearance."

    "summary": "The petition, filed under Article 226, seeks a writ of habeas corpus for the release of Thimmaiyya @ Ravi, detained in Central Prison, Salem under a preventive detention order dated 24‑09‑2022 (S.C.No.35/2022). The order was issued under Tamil Nadu Act No.14 of 1982 on the ground that the detainee was a ‘goonda’ (Section 2(f)). The ground case originated as Crime No.210 of 2022, initially involving IPC Section 302 and later amended to include Sections 143, 294(b), 341, 52(A), 120(B), 302, 201 and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The petitioner argued that there was no live and proximate link between the grounds of detention and its purpose because the remand in the ground case occurred on 03‑08‑2022, yet the detention order was passed over a month later, constituting an unexplained delay. The respondents contended that the delay was necessary for material collection. Relying on the Supreme Court’s Banik judgment, which distinguishes unreasonable from unexplained delay, and on several Madras High Court precedents, the bench held that the delay was unexplained and the detention order invalid. Consequently, the writ was allowed, the detention order set aside, and the detainee ordered to be released forthwith.",
    "facts": "Thimmaiyya @ Ravi, aged 38, was detained in Central Prison, Salem under a preventive detention order dated 24‑09‑2022 issued by the District Collector (second respondent) under Tamil Nadu Act No.14 of 1982, labeling him a ‘goonda’. The ground case (Crime No.210 of 2022) stemmed from alleged murder (IPC 302) and related offences, later amended to include several IPC sections and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The petitioner, Hemavathi, his wife, filed a habeas corpus petition under Article 226 seeking his release, alleging that the detention order was passed after an unexplained delay and lacked a live and proximate link between the grounds and purpose of detention.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that the detention order was issued on 24‑09‑2022 despite the remand in the ground case occurring on 03‑08‑2022, creating an unexplained delay and breaking the required live and proximate link between grounds and purpose of detention. Respondents’ counsel contended that the delay was justified for collection of material and that procedural requirements were met.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the principle laid down in Sushanta Kumar Banik’s case, distinguishing between unreasonable and unexplained delay. It held that the delay here was unexplained, as no satisfactory explanation was provided by the State. The Court also noted that preventive detention is not punitive and must strictly adhere to procedural safeguards, including a demonstrable link between grounds and purpose. Citing Madras High Court precedents that followed Banik, the Court found the detention order defective and set it aside, ordering the detainee’s release.",

Considering  the  facts  and \ncircumstances of the case and nature of ground case , we find that this \nexplanation  of  learned  State  Additional  Public  Pros ecutor  is \nunacceptable.  \n7.  We  remind  ourselves  of  Sushanta  Kumar  Banik's  case \n[Sushanta Kumar Banik Vs. State of Tripura & others reporte d \nin 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 813 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1333 ].

Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in Banik case law  that \nthis point has two facets.  One facet is 'unreasona ble delay' and other \nfacet is 'unexplained delay'.  We find that the cap tioned matter falls \nunder latter facet i.e.,  unexplained delay.\n8.

On 22 April 2022, the matter was listed for hearing, but the plaintiff did not appear.

No.201 of 2016) challenges a decree dated 06‑08‑2015 of the VI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai, which awarded compensation for land acquired under Award No.1/2011 to the 1st claimant, C.S. Premkumar (deceased). The appellants – four siblings (P.T. Chandrasekaran, P.T. Vijayalakshmi, P.T. Vivekanandan, P.T. Sethumadhavan) – claim that they have been in exclusive possession of the land since 1982, have mortgaged it, and thus acquired title by adverse possession. They argue the trial court ignored documentary evidence (Ex.C8‑C18) supporting their claim. The respondents, led by the Special Deputy Collector, rely on a settlement deed dated 28‑08‑1980 (Ex.C1) showing the land was settled in favour of the 1st claimant, and contend the appellants never possessed the land without the true owner's knowledge. The High Court examined the settlement deed, the lack of proof of continuous, hostile possession, and the absence of tax receipts or other evidence of adverse possession. Citing Supreme Court precedents on adverse possession, the Court held that the 1st claimant’s title was valid and the trial court’s award was correct. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed and the connected miscellaneous petition closed.",
    "facts": "The land was acquired for a railway over‑bridge under Award No.1/2011 (15‑07‑2011). A settlement deed dated 28‑08‑1980 transferred the land to C.S. Premkumar, the 1st claimant. The appellants, his nephews, occupied the land from 1982, mortgaged it in 1995 and 2001, and claimed ownership by adverse possession. The 1st claimant died; his heirs were impleaded as respondents R3‑R7. The trial court awarded compensation only to the 1st claimant, rejecting the appellants' claim. The appellants appealed, asserting adverse possession and challenging the trial court’s omission of their documentary evidence.",
    "arguments": "Appellants argued that continuous possession since 1982, mortgage transactions, and lack of any objection by the true owner established adverse possession, and that the trial court erred by not considering Ex.C8‑C18. Respondents argued that the settlement deed unequivocally vested title in the 1st claimant, that the appellants’ possession was with the claimant’s knowledge, and that the appellants failed to prove hostile, exclusive possession or the right to mortgage the land, citing Supreme Court decisions on adverse possession.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the settlement deed confirming the 1st claimant’s ownership and noted that the appellants admitted this deed. It found the appellants failed to demonstrate possession without the true owner’s knowledge, lacked tax receipts, and did not establish the right to mortgage the land. Relying on SC precedents that require clear, uninterrupted, hostile possession for adverse possession, the Court concluded the trial judge’s finding that the 1st claimant was entitled to compensation was legally sound and required no interference.",

The appellants are the \nclaimants 2 to 5 and the 2nd respondent is the 1st claimant in \nthe said LAOP.  \n     3.After perusing the oral and documentary evidence, the \nlearned VI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai, held that \nonly the 2nd respondent/1st claimant is entitled to receive the \ncompensation amount as per the norms passed by the Referring \nOfficer  in  Award  No.1/2011,  dated  15.07.2011  and  the \nappellants / claimants 2 to 5 are not entitled to claim the \naward amount. Challenging the above fair and decreetal order, \nthe present appeal has been filed by the appellants / claimants \n2 to 5.\n4.The case of the appellants/claimants 2 to 5 is that the \nproperty under reference is originally belonged to the uncle of \nthe claimants 2 to 5 namely, P.C.T.Sambandham, who is none other \nthan the elder brother of the claimants' father Thayumanavan. \nThe claimants 2 to 5 are in exclusive possession and enjoyment \nof the property from the year 1982, while their father was alive \nand even after the demise of their father, they have been \ncontinuing their occupation in the acquired land and in the \nremaining property.  The 1st respondent / 1st claimant had never \nbeen in possession of the acquired land. The claimants 2 to 5 \nhave mortgaged the property twice in 1995 and again in 2001 and \nexercised their right over the acquired land.  Hence, the 1st \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nclaimant is not entitled to receive the compensation.  The Court \nbelow, without considering the documents filed by the appellants \nto show that they have prescribed the title by way of adverse \npossession, has passed a fair and decreetal order in favour of \nthe 2nd respondent/1st claimant.  Challenging the same, the \nappellants are before this Court.\n5. Pending this appeal, since the 2nd respondent/1st \nclaimant died, his legal heirs were impleaded as the respondents \n3 to 7.\n6.  This  Court  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nappellants as well as the learned counsel for the respondents 3 \nto 7.\n7. The learned counsel for the appellants would submit \nthat the appellants have prescribed their title by way of \nadverse possession since 1982 and to prove the said contention, \nthe appellants have filed the documents in Ex.C8 to Ex.C18, but \nthe same has not been considered by the Court below. Eventhough \nit is alleged by the 2nd respondent/1st claimant that he has \ngiven permission to the appellants to reside in the property, \nthe same has not been proved by him.  The onus is on the 1st \nclaimant to prove that he has given permission to reside.  The \n1st claimant had never been in possession of the suit property. \nFurther, he would submit that  the appellants have mortgaged the \nproperty after they became the absolute owners of the property. \nTherefore, the findings of the Court below that  the 1st \nclaimant had perfected his title over the acquired land and is \nentitled to receive the compensation amount are erroneous in law \nand therefore, the fair and decreetal order passed by the Court \nbelow needs interference by this Court and hence, he  prays to \nallow this appeal.  \n8. The learned counsel for the respondents 3 to 7 would \nsubmit  that  as  per  the  settlement  deed  Ex.C1,  the  2nd \nrespondent/1st claimant is the owner of the property and his \ntitle was also admitted by the appellants/claimants 2 to 5. \nBut, the appellants are in possession of the suit property \nwithout the knowledge of the true owner and therefore, they are \nnot entitled to claim title by way of adverse possession. He \nwould rely on the decisions reported in (i) (2017) 13 Supreme \nCourt Cases 705 [Dagadabai (dead) by Legal Representatives vs. \nAbbas Alias Gulab Rustum Pinjari]  and (ii) (2019) 15 Supreme \nCourt Cases 756 [Mallikarjunaiah vs. Nanjaiah and others)  and \nhence, the award passed by the trial Court is in accordance with \nlaw.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n9. This Court considered the submissions made on either \nside and also perused the materials placed on record.  For the \nsake of convenience, the parties herein after are referred to as \nthey were arrayed in the suit.\n10. The point for consideration is, as to whether the \nimpugned fair and decreetal order  of the Court below is \nsustainable or not?\n11.  On  a  perusal  of  Ex.C1,  settlement  deed  dated \n28.08.1980, it reveals that the acquired land was settled in \nfavour of the 1st claimant, namely, C.S.Premkumar, by one \nP.C.Thirugnana Sambanda Muadaliar, who is his uncle.  The said \nfact has also been admitted by the claimants 2 to 5. To prove \nthe contention raised by the claimants 2 to 5 that they had \nperfected their title by adverse possession, they have filed \nEx.C8 to Ex.C18. Even though the claimants 2 to 5 have marked \nthe aforesaid documents, they have failed to prove that they are \nin possession and enjoyment of the acquired land  without the \nknowledge of the true owner.  Further, with regard to the \ncontention of the claimants 2 to 5 that they have mortgaged the \nacquired land,  they ought to have been proved  under what right \nthey have mortgaged the said property. But, they have miserably \nfailed to do so. Moreover, the claimants 2 to 5 have not filed \nany documents viz., tax receipts and water tax receipts to prove \ntheir claim that they had perfected their title by adverse \npossession.   \n     12.  At the same time, the 1st claimant has marked Ex.C1, \nsettlement deed and Ex.C2, patta and other documents to prove \nhis claim that he is the owner of the acquired land.  Though the \n1st claimant is the owner of the property and it was also \nadmitted by the claimants 2 to 5, but claiming right over the \nproperty without proving their title by adverse possession, is \nnot correct.\n  \n     13. In view of the above, this Court finds that the learned \nVI Assistant Judge, City Civil Court, Chennai,  after a careful \nperusal of the oral and documentary evidence adduced by both \nsides, has rightly come to a conclusion that the 1st claimant is \nentitled for the compensation  of award amount and hence, the \norder  passed  by  the  Court  below  does  not  warrants  any \ninterference by this Court and the present appeal is liable to \nbe dismissed. \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n14. In fine, this Appeal Suit  stands dismissed. No \ncosts.

    "summary": "The petitioner filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act alleging that the respondent failed to honour a cheque of Rs.3,60,000 dated 11‑08‑2018. The respondent repaid Rs.1,62,840 on 30‑08‑2018, leaving a balance that remained unpaid. The learned Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track, Magisterial Level, Poonamallee acquitted the respondent on 26‑10‑2022, holding that the transaction was unsustainable. The petitioner challenged the acquittal, contending that the trial court erred by not giving due weight to the partial repayment and by misapplying the law. The High Court, after perusing the record, observed that the trial court had indeed overlooked the admission of repayment and that a prima facie case existed for re‑appreciation of evidence. Consequently, the Court granted leave to the petitioner to file a criminal appeal against the acquittal order, directing the registry to number the appeal if otherwise in order. The judgment underscores the necessity for trial courts to consider all material facts, especially partial payments, when adjudicating offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.",

It  is  seen  from  the  records  that,  the  Trial  Court  has  acquitted  the \nrespondent from the charge under Section 138 of Negoti able Instruments Act. The \ntrial Court in paragraph 5 of its order recorded that the  total balance amount of \nRs.3,60,000/- to be paid by the accused. To discharge the  said amout, the accused \nissued a cheque bearing No.872786  for a sum of Rs.3,60,0 00/- on 11.08.2018. \nThe  accused husband  has repaid  a  sum of  Rs.1,62,840  on 30. 08.2018.

    "summary": "The Madras High Court heard two civil appeals (A.S.No.963/2015 and A.S.No.4/2015) arising from a common judgment of the II Additional District Court, Tindivanam, concerning a dispute between M/s. Aurosimon (Auro Food Ltd.) and M/s. R.T. Exports Ltd. over supply and erection of rice‑mill machinery at the defendant’s Haryana plant. The plaintiff claimed Rs 25,13,296.72, alleging non‑payment despite delivery and installation, and sought interest at 9% p.a. The trial court awarded the balance of Rs 12,97,373.72, a “C” form of Rs 3,50,723, and interest at 12% from installation to filing, later reducing it to 6% from decree to realization, rejecting any interest from filing to decree. The defendants appealed, challenging the award of interest, the trial court’s jurisdiction (arguing cause of action arose in Haryana, not Tindivanam), and alleging defective machinery and limitation. The High Court examined the jurisdictional objection, the applicability of Section 61(2) Sale of Goods Act for interest, and the defect claims. It upheld the trial court’s jurisdiction, affirmed the interest award at 6% post‑decree, and dismissed the appeals, finding no substantive proof of machinery defects or limitation bars. The judgment thus reinstated the trial court’s decree and interest award.",
    "facts": "M/s. Aurosimon supplied and erected three rice‑mill plants for M/s. R.T. Exports at Kundli, Haryana, under work orders dated 21‑02‑1994, 22‑09‑1995 and 26‑02‑1996. The total contract value was Rs 25,13,296.72. The defendant paid only Rs 1,50,000 and failed to settle the balance of Rs 12,97,373.72 despite repeated notices. The plaintiff alleged no defect in the machinery and that the installations were accepted. The defendant contended that the machinery was defective, that the cause of action arose in Haryana (thus challenging jurisdiction), and that the suit was barred by limitation.",
    "arguments": "The plaintiff argued that the defendant was liable for the full contract price, that interest was payable under Section 61(2) Sale of Goods Act, and that the trial court had jurisdiction as the cause of action arose where the contract was executed. The defendant argued lack of jurisdiction of the Tindivanam court, alleged defects in the machinery, claimed substantial loss and expenses, and raised a limitation defence, asserting the suit was filed three years after the cause of action arose.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the contract and performance occurred in Haryana but the cause of action—demand for payment—arose in Tindivanam where the plaintiff filed suit, establishing jurisdiction. Applying Section 61(2) Sale of Goods Act, the Court affirmed the trial court’s discretion to award interest, accepting the 6% post‑decree rate and rejecting any pre‑decree interest due to the parties’ delay. The defect allegations were unsupported by evidence; the defendant failed to produce documents or expert testimony. The limitation defence was dismissed as the suit was filed within the statutory period for a money claim. Consequently, the appeals were dismissed and the trial court’s decree upheld.",

SUNDAR, J. )\nThe plaintiff in the suit in O.S.No.2 of 2011  on the fi le of the II \nAdditional District Court, Tindivanam, is the appellant  in A.S.No.963 of \n2015 and the defendant in the suit is the appellant in  A.S.No.4 of 2015. \nSince both these appeals arise out of a common judgment, bo th the appeals \nare taken up together and disposed of by this common judgment .\n2.Brief facts that are necessary for the disposal of th ese appeals are as \nfollows :\n2.1.The  plaintiff/respondent  in  A.S.No.4  of 2015  filed  the  suit  in \nO.S.No.2 of 2011 for recovery of a sum of Rs.16,48,09 6.72 towards supply \nof machineries to the defendant/appellant in A.S.No.4  of 2015 with interest \nat the rate of 18% p.a. as on 31.03.1999.  Therefore, the total suit claim is \nPage 3 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\nRs.25,13,296.72.  \n2.2.It  is  the  case  of  the  plaintiff  that  defendant  ente red  into  an \nagreement  with  the  plaintiff  for  supply  of  required  ma chineries  to  the \ndefendant for setting up three rice mills in his factor y at Kundli in the State \nof Haryana and that the defendant also agreed to pay t he bill for machineries \nafter installation of the rice mill.  It is admitted that the plaintiff agreed to \nmake good any part of machinery or plant, which under p roper use fail \nowing  to  the  defective  material  or  design  within  6  month s  after  the \ninstallation.\n2.3.It is the further case of plaintiff that the defend ant placed work \norder on three occasions.  On the first occasion, i.e.,  on 21.02.1994, the \ndefendant wanted supply of machineries for setting u p a rice mill with a \ncapacity of 5 Tons of paddy line and the second work ord er was placed on \n22.09.1995 for supply of machineries to install a ric e mill with a capacity of \n8 Tons of paddy line and the 3rd purchase order was on 26.02.1996 for \nsupply of machineries to set up a rice mill with a capacity of 25 Tons of \npaddy line.  It is admitted that all the three rice mills were installed in the \ndefendant's factory at Kundli in the State of Haryana.  \nPage 4 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\n2.4.It is the case of plaintiff that there was a runni ng account between \nthe plaintiff and defendant and after supply of mach ineries, there was a \nheavy balance due from the defendant and that the plai ntiff was repeatedly \nasking the defendant to remit the balance and clear the ou tstanding as per \nthe statement of accounts from the plaintiff.  Despite  receipt of the accounts \nsent by the plaintiff, it is stated by the plaintiff th at the defendant had sent a \ncheque only for a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- towards part pay ment by a letter \ndated  21.02.1997.   Thereafter,  the  plaintiff  sent  ano ther  letter  dated \n20.06.1997 by registered post asking the defendant to cle ar the outstanding \nbalance amount which is Rs.12,97,373.72.  \n2.5.After issuing notice once again for recovery of Rs.1 2,97,373.72 \nalong with a sum of Rs.3,50,723/- towards “C” Form, t he plaintiff filed the \nsuit.\n2.6.In  the  plaint,  the  plaintiff also  stated  that  def endant  had  not \ncomplained about any defect in the machineries till th e plaintiff's money \nclaim  was  raised  against  the  defendant  and  that  the  machineries  were \nsuccessfully  erected  by  the  plaintiff  which  was  acknowle dged  by  the \ndefendant.\nPage 5 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\n3.The suit was contested by the defendant/appellant in A .S.No.4 of \n2015 on various contentions.  A preliminary objection was  raised by the \ndefendant questioning the jurisdiction of the trial Court  to entertain the suit \non  the  ground  that  no  part  of  cause  of  action  had  arise n  within  the \njurisdiction of II Additional District Court, Tindivanam.   It is specifically \ncontended by the defendant that the defendant placed pur chase orders with \nthe plaintiff at Kundli District in the State of Harya na and that the plaintiff \nhad  agreed  specifically  to  supply  and  erect  three  ric e  mill  plants  at \ndefendant's premises.  In the written statement, it i s also stated that no \npayments  were made at Tindivanam, and  therefore, no par t of cause of \naction  arose  at  Tindivanam,  stating  that  the  evidence  bo th  oral  and \ndocumentary is available only at Kundli District, in H arayana State, it is \ncontended that the defendant will be put to grave preju dice and irretrievable \ninjustice if they are made to defend their case in Ti ndivanam. \n4.An application was filed by defendant in I.A.No.371 of 2009 to \ndecide the preliminary objection as a preliminary issue .  It is seen that the \nPage 6 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\ntrial Court dismissed the Interlocutory Application by hol ding that the Court \nin which the suit is laid has jurisdiction to decide the sui t, after recording the \nfact that payments were received by way of cheques at t he place of plaintiff \nand that the plaintiff has gone to the defendant's pl ace only for erection of \nthree rice mills.  Though the Interlocutory Application fi led by the defendant \nin I.A.No.371 of 2009 was dismissed by trial Court, no revision petition is \nfiled by the defendant questioning the decision of the t rial Court on the \npreliminary issue.  \n5.On merits, the defendant contended that the machineries supplied \nby plaintiff were defective and that the defendant suffe red loss and extreme \nhardships because of the fact that the supply was not  in accordance with the \nagreement. A few defects in the machineries were specif ically referred to in \nthe  written  statement  and  it  is  stated  that  the  defen dants  had  spent \nsubstantial amount to make the machineries and equipme nts supplied by the \nplaintiff meet the requirements and the assured capa city.  The defendant also \nraised a plea that the suit itself is barred by limita tion, as the suit has been \nlaid  three  years  after  the  cause  of action  arose  for  recovery  of money \nPage 7 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\ntowards goods supplied by plaintiff to the defendant.  \n6.Though there are other grounds  raised in the written statement, \nexcept  the  three  grounds  as  stated  above,  learned  coun sel  for  the \ndefendant/appellant  in  A.S.No.4  of  2015  has  not  argued  anything  else. \nTherefore, we do not propose to extract the other defence r aised by the \ndefendant in the written statement.  \n7.Before the trial Court,  plaintiff examined one Mr.Selvam ani, the \nProprietor  of plaintiff concern,  as  P.W.1.   On  behalf of defendant,  one \nMr.P.M.Mohan was examined as D.W.1.  Exs.A1 to A70 were mar ked on \nthe side of the plaintiff and Exs.B1 to B5 were marke d on the side of the \ndefendant.\n8.The trial Court framed the following issues :\ni. Whether defendant is liable to pay a sum of Rs.25, 13,296.72  \ntowards the erection of rice mill machineries, 'C' form and  \ninterest ?\nii. Whether suit is liable to be rejected on the gro und that this  \nPage 8 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\nCourt has no jurisdiction ?\niii. Whether there was any defect in the machineries  such as wells  \nelevators etc., during the erection of rice mills ?\niv. Whether plaintiff is entitled to the relief as s ought for in the \nplaint ?\n9.On the issue whether the defendant is liable to pay the amount \ntowards erection of rice mill machineries, “C” Form and interest, the trial \nCourt  held  that  the  defendant  is  liable  to  pay  the  bal ance  amount  of \nRs.12,97,373.72 and a further sum of Rs.3,50,723/- t owards “C” Form, in \nall, a sum of Rs.16,48,096.72.  However, the trial Court held that there is no \nagreement for payment of interest and therefore, as per S ection 61(2) of Sale \nof Goods Act, 1930, Court may award interest at such rat e, and held that the \nplaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 12% p.a. From the date of \ninstallation  of  machineries,  i.e.,  01.12.1996  till  th e  date  of  plaint,  i.e., \n07.06.1999.  However, on the ground that the plaintif f as well as defendant \ndid not show any interest in conducting the trial of the cas e for long time, \nthe trial Court held that the plaintiff is not entitled  to any interest from the \ndate of plaint till the date of decree, as both of them  have jointly dragged the \nPage 9 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\nproceedings for 15 years.  However, the trial Court g ranted interest at the \nrate of 6% p.a. from the date of decree till date of  realization.  Since the \nissue relating to jurisdiction has already been decide d by the trial Court, the \ntrial Court, while disposing of the suit on all other is sues, did not consider \nthe issue regarding jurisdiction raised by the defendant.  The trial Court then \nfound that the defendant has not filed any document to e stablish that the \ndefendant suffered heavy loss or expenses towards purch ase of spares or due \nto the defects in the machineries supplied by the plai ntiff.  Holding that the \ndefendant has not even given the details of defects foun d in the machineries \nsupplied by plaintiff during evidence, the trial Court decided the issue in \nfavour of plaintiff.\n10.Aggrieved  by  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the  trial  Cou rt,  the \ndefendant preferred the appeal in A.S.No.4 of 2015 an d the plaintiff has \npreferred the appeal in A.S.No.963 of 2015.\n11.Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant  in  A.S.No.4  of \n2015/defendant  submitted  that  the  trial  Court  failed  to  appreciate  the \nPage 10 of 21\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.S.Nos.963 and 4 of 2015\nevidence of D.W.1 regarding the defective and faulty machineries supplied \nby respondent/p",

    "summary": "The plaintiffs, Scientific Compounds and Processes Private Ltd. and ECOF Detergents Private Ltd., filed a civil suit (C.S.No.833 of 2000) in the Madras High Court seeking permanent injunctions against Hanuman Cottage Industry for alleged infringement of their registered trademark ‘SABENA’, use of the similar mark ‘SUBEENA’, and copying of their artistic work on polythene pouches. The reliefs included injunctions to restrain use of the infringing marks, destruction of infringing goods, an account of profits, and damages of Rs.10,05,000. The suit invoked Sections 27, 28, 29, 105 and 106 of the Trade Marks Act, 1958 and Sections 51, 55, 62 and 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957. During the hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court that the defendant’s products were no longer in the market and the plaintiffs wished to withdraw the suit. The court recorded the withdrawal, dismissed the suit as withdrawn, ordered no costs, and reserved liberty for the plaintiffs to approach the court in the future if a cause of action arises. The judgment reflects procedural disposal rather than substantive adjudication on the trademark and copyright claims.",
    "facts": "The plaintiffs own the registered trademark ‘SABENA’ for cleaning powder and an artistic design on polythene pouches. The defendant was allegedly marketing cleaning powder and pouches bearing the mark ‘SUBEENA’ and a design substantially similar to the plaintiffs’ work, constituting infringement and passing off. The plaintiffs sought injunctions, destruction of infringing goods, account of profits, and damages. The defendant’s products were later removed from the market.",
    "arguments": "Plaintiffs argued that the defendant’s use of ‘SUBEENA’ and similar pouch design violated the Trade Marks Act and Copyright Act, causing confusion and loss of goodwill. They sought comprehensive injunctive relief and monetary compensation. During the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel indicated a withdrawal of the suit as the infringing products were no longer available.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court noted the plaintiffs’ instruction to withdraw the suit. In accordance with procedural law, the suit was dismissed as withdrawn. No substantive examination of the trademark or copyright infringement issues was undertaken. The court ordered no costs and allowed the plaintiffs to approach the court in the future if a new cause of action arises.",

The petition argued that the certified copy was either unavailable or that its production would cause undue hardship and that the substantive issues could be decided on the basis of the original order and the material on record. The respondents contended that the certified copy was essential for verifying the authenticity of the impugned order and that the procedural rule could not be waived. The Bench comprising the Chief Justice and Justice Senthilkumaar Ramamoorthy examined the statutory provisions governing writ proceedings and held that the High Court has inherent powers to dispense with procedural formalities where strict compliance would defeat the ends of justice. Consequently, the petition was allowed, and the requirement to produce the certified copy was waived. The judgment underscores the court's discretion to relax procedural mandates in the interest of substantive justice.",

The petitioner alleged that despite submitting the application, the RTO had not received it. The respondent, represented by Government Advocate Mr. Annai Ezhil, produced a written instruction indicating that the RTO had not received any such application and that there existed an objection from the Salem Bus Owners Association, which had filed a separate writ petition (W.P. No. 30613 of 2019) pending before the same court. The court examined the respondent’s claim and, finding no evidence that the application had been received in the prescribed format, declined to issue a mandamus. Instead, the court directed the petitioner to re‑file the application in the correct format within two weeks and the RTO to consider it within three weeks of receipt, without any costs. The order effectively dismissed the petition while ensuring procedural compliance for future filing.",
    "facts": "The petitioner submitted an application on 7‑12‑2020 for an autorickshaw permit to operate within a 30 km radius of Salem Town Old Bus Stand. He claimed the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) had not received the application. The respondent RTO asserted that no application had been received and cited an objection from the Salem Bus Owners Association, which had a pending writ petition concerning new autorickshaw permits.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the RTO’s refusal to accept his application violated his right to obtain a permit and sought a writ of mandamus compelling acceptance. Respondent argued that no application had been received in the prescribed format, that there was an objection from the bus owners’ association, and that any pending writ did not preclude consideration of a new application.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court found that the respondent had not produced any evidence of receipt of the petitioner’s application in the required format. It noted that procedural compliance is a prerequisite for the RTO to consider any permit application. The objection by the bus owners’ association, while noted, did not automatically bar the acceptance of a properly filed application.

The petitioner argued that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court because the petitioner’s registered office and the servers storing the data are located in Chennai. Senior counsel emphasized the urgency of the matter, citing potential irreparable harm from the threatened data release. The Court examined the draft plaint and found that at least a part of the cause of action indeed arose within its territorial jurisdiction. Consequently, the Court granted leave to sue, directed the Registry to number the suit, and ordered that the interim application accompanying the suit be listed for admission on 03.01.2023. No specific statutes or precedents were cited. The order reflects the Court’s discretionary power to allow a suit when jurisdictional criteria are satisfied and the matter is of urgent nature.",

The petitioner alleges that the respondents illegally accessed the petitioner’s computer systems and are threatening to publish confidential customer information.

    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that the alleged hacking and the location of the data constitute a cause of action arising in Chennai, giving the High Court jurisdiction. The counsel also stressed the urgency due to the risk of data leakage, requesting immediate leave to sue. No substantive defense or counter‑argument from respondents was presented in the order.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court reviewed the draft plaint and determined that the essential elements of the cause of action—namely the location of the petitioner’s registered office and the servers—are within its territorial jurisdiction.

    "summary": "On 25 April 2022, the Madras High Court, headed by Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup, heard Criminal Original Petition No.84 of 2019 (and Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No.104 of 2019) filed by E. M. Saravanan seeking to set aside an order dated 5 January 2018, passed by Judicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi, granting maintenance to his wife. The petitioner argued that the wife had left the matrimonial home alleging an illegal affair, a claim he said was unproven, and therefore she was not entitled to maintenance. The respondents (Lalitha, Selvi, Minor S. Ajith) contended that the minor children had attained majority, so maintenance against them was irrelevant, and the petition sought relief only against the wife. The Court examined the scope of Section 482 CrPC, citing the Supreme Court's guidelines in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, which restrict the use of extraordinary powers to cases lacking evidentiary material. It held that the maintenance order was based on a factual enquiry by the Judicial Magistrate, and the High Court could not interfere merely because the petitioner disputed the wife’s conduct. Consequently, the petition was dismissed, and the Magistrate was directed to consider any future applications for arrears of maintenance within three months. The connected Criminal Miscellaneous Petition was also closed.",
    "facts": "E. M. Saravanan (petitioner) was married to the wife who claimed maintenance. The Judicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi, on 5 January 2018, granted maintenance to the wife after evaluating evidence. The petitioner challenged this order, alleging the wife left the marital home due to an alleged illegal affair, which he claimed was not proved. The petition also referenced a prior order dated 24 September 2018 from the First Additional District and Sessions Court, Coimbatore, confirming the Magistrate's order. The respondents included Lalitha, Selvi, and Minor S. Ajith, who were minor children at the time of the original maintenance claim.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner: Asserted that the wife’s alleged adultery was unproven, thus she was not entitled to maintenance; sought to set aside the Magistrate’s order under Section 482 CrPC; relied on the case of Vijayakumar v. Shanmuga Vadivu for maintenance claims. Respondents: Stated that the minor children had attained majority, so maintenance against them was irrelevant; sought relief only against the wife; argued that the Magistrate’s factual findings were sound and could not be disturbed by the High Court.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court emphasized that Section 482 CrPC is an extraordinary power to prevent abuse of the judicial process, not a tool to re‑evaluate evidence. Citing State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, it held that the High Court may intervene only where there is a clear absence of material or a patent error. Here, the maintenance order was based on a detailed evidentiary enquiry by the Judicial Magistrate, which the High Court could not substitute. The petitioner's contention about the wife's alleged affair was a factual dispute already considered by the lower court. Therefore, the High Court could not set aside the order and dismissed the petition.",

Lalitha\n2. Selvi\n3. Minor S.Ajith ...Respondents/Petitioners\nPrayer: This Criminal Original Petition had been filed under\nSection 482 of Criminal Procedure Code to set aside the order\ndated 24.09.2018 in Crl.R.C.No.17 of 2018 on the file of First\nAdditional District and Sessions Court, Coimbatore, conforming\nthe order dated 05.01.2018 in M.C.No.15 of 2015 on the file of\nJudicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi.\nFor  Petitioner :   Mr.K.Sudhakar\nFor Respondents :   Mr.M.N.Balakrishnan\nORDER\nThis Criminal Original Petition had been filed seeking to\nset aside the order dated 24.09.2018 in Crl.R.C.No.17 of 2018\non the file of the learned First Additional District and\nSessions  Court,  Coimbatore,  confirming  the  order  dated\n05.01.2018 in M.C.No.15 of 2015 on the file of Judicial\nMagistrate No.II, Pollachi.\n2. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner had already\nsubmitted his arguments on 04.04.2022. Today, the case is\nposted to hear the learned Counsel for the Respondents. The\nlearned Counsel for the Respondents submits that the minor\nchildren had attained majority and therefore he is not seeking\nrelief of maintenance against the minor children. He is\nseeking relief only against the Respondent/wife. The learned\nCounsel for the Petitioner submitted the ruling of this High\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nCourt reported in the case of \"Vijayakumar Vs Shanmuga Vadivu\nand others\", for the claim of maintenance of the children.\nSince the learned Counsel for the Respondents had submitted\nthat he is not insisting for the maintenance of the minor\nChildren who had attained the age of majority, the reliance\nplaced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner herein has no\nbearing on this case. On appreciation of evidence, the learned\nJudicial  Magistrate  No.II,  Pollachi  had  rejected  the\ncontention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent/husband\ntherein that the wife refused to live with him as she was\nhaving an illegal affair.\n3. This Court, exercising extraordinary powers under\nSection 482 Cr.P.C cannot appreciate the evidence, namely,\nexercise by the Appellate Court. This petition is filed by the\nPetitioner/husband seeking to set aside the order of the\nlearned  Judicial  Magistrate  No.II,  Pollachi,  passed  in\nM.C.No.15 of 15. Based on the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the case of \"State of Haryana Vs.\nBhajan Lal\", the guidelines issued to the High Court is that\nthe extraordinary powers available to the High Court under\nSection 482 Cr.P.C shall not be exercised leniently. Only in\nthe cases where there are no materials found from the case of\nthe prosecution, the High Court can exercise the powers\nsparingly to quash the FIR, to quash the Charge sheet, to\nquash the Criminal complaint. This is the petition to set\naside the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate\nNo.II, Pollachi, regarding the claim of maintenance, which was\nallowed by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi,\nsince the contention of the Petitioner is that the wife\nrefused to live with him on the allegation of adultery by the\nwife which was not proved in the evidence during enquiry\nbefore  the  learned  Judicial  Magistrate  by  the\nhusband/Respondent  before  the  learned  Judicial  Magistrate\nNo.II, Pollachi.  Therefore, she is not entitled to the\nmaintenance is not at all to be accepted as it is for the wife\nto decide under what circumstances she left the matrimonial\nhome and that had been properly appreciated by the learned\nJudicial  Magistrate  No.II,  Pollachi,  in  the  enquiry  by\nappreciation of evidence from both parties. When the learned\nJudicial Magistrate had arrived at the clear conclusion that\nthe wife is entitled to claim the maintenance, this Court,\nexercising the extraordinary powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C\ncannot set aside the order regarding the claim of maintenance\nby the Respondent/wife herein as the Petitioner before the\nCourt of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi.\n4. If this petition is allowed by setting aside the\norder of grant of maintenance, it amounts to setting aside the\norder of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II,Pollachi, which\nis based on evidence, which this Court cannot exercise by\ninvoking extraordinary powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C against\nthe guidelines issued to the High Court by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n5. In the light of the above, this Criminal Original\nPetition is dismissed. The learned Judicial Magistrate is\ndirected to pass appropriate orders if any petition is filed\non behalf of the Petitioner before the Judicial Magistrate\nregarding the collection of arrears of maintenance and other\nresultant benefits within a period of three months thereafter.\nConsequently, connected Criminal Miscellaneous Petition is\nclosed.  \n        \nSd/-\nAssistant Registrar (CS-VII)\n//True Copy//\nSub Assistant Registrar\nmn\nTo\n1.The First Additional District and Sessions Judge, \n  Coimbatore.\n2.The Judicial Magistrate No.II, Pollachi.\n+1cc to Mr.K.Sudhakar, Advocate SR.

    "summary": "The appeal (Suit No.1022 of 1993) filed by Palaniammal and Marimuthu challenges the decree of the Subordinate Judge, Ariyalur, in O.S.No.111 of 1986 concerning partition of family property. The original suit arose after the intestate death of Chinnammal, whose daughter Palaniammal and husband Natesan Servai claimed two‑thirds share of 23 immovable properties. The defendant, Jambulingam Servai (deceased), asserted exclusive possession for over twelve years, invoking a 1936 gift deed (Ex.A1) from his grandfather Karuppanna Servai to Chinnammal, and denied any right of the plaintiffs. The trial court partially allowed the partition suit and the appellants now seek relief on the disallowed portions. The High Court examined documentary evidence, including the 1936 gift deed, a contested 1986 will favoring the third plaintiff, and the custom of male inheritance. It applied Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act to give primacy to the written deed over oral statements. The Court held that the gift deed conclusively transferred ownership to Chinnammal’s line, that the plaintiffs had no exclusive possession, and that the will was not genuine. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower court’s partial allowance and confirming the defendant’s exclusive right to the property.",
    "facts": "Chinnammal owned extensive immovable property. Palaniammal (her daughter) and Natesan Servai (her husband) claimed two‑thirds share after Chinnammal’s intestate death. Jambulingam Servai, Chinnammal’s elder son, occupied the property for over twelve years, asserting ownership based on a 1936 gift deed from his grandfather Karuppanna Servai. Natesan Servai executed a will in 1986 favoring Marimuthu, which was contested. The trial court partially allowed the partition suit; the appeal concerns the disallowed portion.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that they were legal heirs of Chinnammal and entitled to two‑thirds share, that the will of Natesan Servai was valid, and that the defendant’s possession was unlawful. Respondents contended that the 1936 gift deed transferred ownership to Chinnammal’s line, that they had exclusive possession for over twelve years, that the will was forged, and that customary law denied female inheritance.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court gave primacy to the 1936 gift deed (Ex.A1) under Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, finding it authentic and establishing ownership in the male line. It held that the plaintiffs never enjoyed joint possession and that the defendant’s uninterrupted possession for more than twelve years vested a presumption of ownership. The contested 1986 will was deemed not genuine. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, confirming the lower court’s partial decree.",

Hence, in respect of the disallowed portion, the \nplaintiffs have preferred the present Appeal Suit. \n2.For clarity sake, the parties are referred to their \nstatus and ranking found in the trial Court decree. \n3.The factual background of the case:\nO.S.No.111 of 1986:-\nThe suit property belongs to one Chinnammal. The first \nplaintiff Palaniammal is her daughter. The second plaintiff \nNatesan Servai is  the husband of Chinnammal. Chinnammal's elder \nson Jambulingam is the defendant in the suit. On the demise of \nChinnammal intestate, claiming 2/3rd share in the suit property \nof Chinnammal,  the suit has been filed alleging that the \ndefendant  having  developed  animosity  with  the  co-sharers, \ncausing act of waste of the joint family property and also \ndeclining to divide the property among the sharers. Instead of \nallowing them to enjoy the suit property, the defendant filed a \nsuit  against  the  plaintiffs  seeking  permanent  injunction \nrestraining the plaintiffs from interfering the possession. \nHence, there is no purpose in continuing the joint enjoyment. \n4.Pending suit, the second plaintiff (Natesan Servai), \nwho is the husband of Chinnammal died on 19.12.1987.  During his \nlifetime, he had executed a registered Will dated 01.10.1986 in \nfavour of the third plaintiff (Marimuthu) and therefore, the \nthird plaintiff is impleaded being a necessary party. In the \nplaint, 23 items of immovable properties were enlisted in the \nschedule and 2/3rd share claimed in each of the properties.\n \n5.The sole defendant filed his written statement denying \nthe claim of the plaintiffs stating that his mother Chinnammal \nis the daughter of one Karuppanna Servai. The said Karuppanna \nServai had no male issues.  Hence, he and his wife Nallammal \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nbrought up the defendant from his young age and he improved the \nestate of Karuppanna Servai by his hard work. The properties \nwere  handed  over  by  Karuppanna  Servai  and  Nallammal  to \nChinnammal for the benefit of the defendant since the defendant \nwas a minor. The entire suit properties are in possession and \nenjoyment of the defendant for more than 12 years by paying tax. \nThe defendant have no right over the property. The plaintiffs \nnever in joint possession or enjoyed the property jointly at any \npoint of time. The defendant directly inherited the property \nfrom his grand father. Only till he attains majority, during the \ninterregnum period, his mother Chinnammal was administering the \nproperty on his behalf. Chinnammal had no exclusive right in the \nsuit property.  Hence, the plea of the plaintiffs that the suit \nproperty belongs to Chinnammal, is factually incorrect. There is \nno custom to give share in the family property to female \nmembers.  As per custom, the defendant had provided enough \nstreedhanam during the first plaintiff Palaniammal's marriage. \nHe performed the marriage of the first plaintiff,  as per the \nfamily custom.  He provided 32 sovereign of jewels, a cow, 6 \ngoats, two set of silver anklets, 51 items of brass and bronze \narticles, a sheep and periodical Pongal and Deepavali steer. \nBesides that for the past 24 years he has been providing \ngroceries to the first plaintiff as seer as per the custom. \nTherefore, the plaintiffs have no right to seek partition in the \nproperty, which is being enjoyed by him exclusively for more \nthan 12 years. Since the plaintiffs are trying to interfere with \nthe peaceful possession in the suit property, he has already \napproached the Civil Court in O.S.No.349 of 1986 on the file of \nthe Ariyalur District Munsif Court seeking permanent injunction \nagainst the first plaintiff (Palaniammal) and the said suit is \npending.\n6.For recovery of money, he has also initiated another \nsuit O.S.No.345 of 1986 against Palaniammal and others. His \nfather, who is the second plaintiff, is 80 years old. Certain \nproperties were purchased in his name being the eldest male \nmember of the family. Taking advantage of his old age,  the \nfirst plaintiff in connivance with son are trying to manipulate \ndocuments to snatch away the properties which he has purchased \nin the name of his father the second plaintiff.  The properties \nwere purchased by the defendant in the name of his father and he \nis only a name lender.  In fact, the defendant is entitled for \nshare in the property, which the second plaintiff got through \npartition among his brothers. The suit properties exclusively \nbelongs to the defendant. Neither his sister (first plaintiff) \nnor his son (third plaintiff) and his father (second plaintiff) \nhave any right over the property. Even if so, they have lost \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\ntheir right being ousted from the property for more than 12 \nyears.  The  alleged  Will  executed  by  the  second  plaintiff \n(Natesan Servai) in favour of the third plaintiff (Marimuthu) is \nnot a valid and genuine document. The third plaintiff cannot be \na legal heir of the second plaintiff (Natesan Servai). On \n20.06.1984 Natesan Servai was not in good state of mind to \nexecute the Will with free mind and there was no necessity for \nhim to execute the Will.  The alleged Will dated 01.10.1986 in \nfavour of the third plaintiff executed by plaintiffs 1 and 2 is \nalso not a genuine Will.,\n7.Based on the pleadings, the trial Court has framed the \nfollowing issues:-\n(1)Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for \nthe relief as prayed?\n(2)Whether the suit property belongs to \nthe deceased Chinnammal?\n(3)Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for \nthe share in the suit property?\n(4)Whether the Will dated 01.10.1986 and \n20.06.1984 prepounded by the plaintiffs are true \nand valid?\n(5)Whether the properties in the name of \nNatesan Servai (2nd plaintiff) were purchased out \nof income derived through the properties allotted \nunder the deed dated 12.08.1936?\n(6)Whether  Natesan  Servai  had  any \nancestral property at the time of purchasing the \nproperty\n in his name?\n(7)Whether the defendant is entitled for \nthe counter claim?\n(8)Whether the property claimed by the \ndefendant in his counter claim can be subjected to \npartition?\n(9)What other relief the plaintiffs are \nentitled to?\n \nO.S.No.349 of 1986:\n8.The suit in O.S.No.349 of 1986 filed by Jambulingam \nseeking permanent injunction against Palaniammal was renumbered \nas O.S.No.86 of 1987. In this suit, Jambulingam claiming right \nand title over the suit property pleaded, he is enjoying the \nproperty by cultivating and harping the yield. Palaniammal have \nno right in the property.  However, she with the help of her \nhenchmen is trying to interfere with his peaceful possession. \nHence,  prays for permanent injunction. \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n9.The first plaintiff (Palaniammal) as defendant in the \nsuit in O.S.No.86 of 1987 filed a written statement denying the \nallegations. According to her pleadings, the suit property is \nnot in exclusive possession of the defendant (Jambulingam). In \nthe residence, the plaintiff (Jambulingam) is not in exclusive \noccupation. It is in correct to plea that the suit property \nbelongs to the parents of Chinnammal and they allotted the suit \nproperty to Jambulingam as per the family arrangements. In fact, \nthe property belongs to Chinnammal and she died intestate 10 \nyears prior to institution of the suit and after her death, her \nhusband  Natesan  Servai  and  children  (Palaniammal)  and \n(Jambulingam) were jointly enjoying the property. Therefore, the \nplaintiff  (Jambulingam)  cannot  seek  injunction  against  co-\nsharer.  Further, the defendant (Palaniammal) and her father \n(Natesan Servai) had jointly executed a Will in favour of \nMarimuthu on 01.10.1986 in respect of their share in the suit \nproperty. Therefore, the suit for permanent injunction filed by \nthe  plaintiff  (Jambulingam)  against  co-sharer  is  not \nmaintainable. \n10.Based on the pleadings, the trial Court has framed the \nfollowing issues in O.S.No.86 of 1987:-\n(1)Whether  the  suit  property  being  in \nenjoyment of the plaintiff for more than 12 years?\n(2)Whether the suit property belongs to the \nplaintiff?\n(3)Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the \nrelief as prayed?\n11.Before commencement of examination of witnesses, a \njoint memo was filed by parties to take evidence recorded in \nO.S.No.111 of 1986 filed by Palaniammal and others as evidence \nfor O.S.No.86 of 1987 filed by Jambulingam also. Accordingly, \ncommon  evidence  recorded  in  O.S.No.111  of  1986  filed  by \nPalaiammal and others against Jambulingam. \n12.On  behalf  of  the  plaintiffs,  Palaniammal  (first \nplaintiff) and Rajangam (attestor to the Will Ex.A-2) were \nexamined as witnesses and four exhibits were marked. On behalf \nof defendant, the defendant (Jambulingam) and five others were \nexamined as witnesses and 31 exhibits were marked. \n13.Ex.A1 is the gift deed executed by Karuppanna Servai \nin favour of Chinnammal. The deed is accepted by both the \nparties.  While the plaintiffs claimed right over the property \non  the  premises  that  in  the  suit  properties  belongs  to \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nChinnammal, the defendant (Jambulingam) claims that his grand \nfather Karuppanna Servai executed gift deed Ex.A1 in the name of \nhis mother Chinnammal  because he was minor at that point of \ntime and in fact, Karuppanna Servai gifted the property only to \nthe defendant and not to the mother of the defendant. Some of \nthe suit properties in fact were purchased by him in the name of \nhis  father  Natesan  Servai  and  few  other  properties  were \npurchased in the name of his mother Chinnammal. However, all the \nproperties were purchased from out of the income derived from \nhis exertion.  \n14.The trial Court, after appreciating the documentary \nevidence and the witnesses spoken about the documents namely, \nEx.A1 and Ex.B15 to Ex.B19 has held, that Ex.A1 is the gift deed \ndated 12.08.1936. As per the recitals, Karuppanna Servai has \nsettled absolutely the suit schedule mentioned property as Items \nNo.6,7,8,9,10,12 to 15,19 and 23 in favour of his sole daughter \nChinnammal. The gift is in praesenti. The said document Ex.A1 is \nof the year 1936, which is nearly 55 years old document. The \nsuit property is described in the deed as absolutely self-\nacquired property of Karuppanna Servai. Any oral statement \ncontrary to the written document is subject to Section 92 of the \nIndian Evidence Act, 1872. Therefore, the plea of the defendant \n(Jambulingam) that the real intention of Karuppanna Servai was \nto gift the property to him and not to his mother,  however, at \nthe time of the gift deed Ex.A1, he was minor and therefore, \nKaruppanna Servai gifted ",

    "summary": "The petition, filed by Sikkamma under Article 226, sought a writ of habeas corpus for her son Mallesh (also known as Battli), who was detained in Central Prison, Salem under a preventive detention order dated 24 September 2022, issued by the District Collector and Magistrate of Krishnagiri. The order was based on the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act, 1982, classifying the detainee as a \"goonda\" under Section 2(f). The ground case involved IPC Section 302 and related offences arising from a crime registered on 4 August 2022. The petitioner argued that there was no live and proximate link between the grounds and the purpose of detention, highlighting an unexplained delay of over a month between the remand date and the detention order. The State contended that the delay was necessary for material collection. The Court, relying on the Supreme Court’s Banik judgment, distinguished between unreasonable and unexplained delay, finding the present case fell within the latter. It also noted that the High Court had previously applied Banik in several HCP orders. Concluding that the detention order was vitiated by unexplained delay, the Court set aside the order and directed the immediate release of the detainee, without costs. The order was signed by Justices M. Sundar and M. Nirmal Kumar on 17 April 2023.",
    "facts": "Mallesh @ Battli, a 25‑year‑old son of Mallappa, was detained in Central Prison, Salem under a preventive detention order dated 24‑09‑2022 (S.C. No.37/2022) issued by the District Collector and Magistrate of Krishnagiri. The order was made under Tamil Nadu Act No.14 of 1982, classifying him as a \"goonda\". The underlying criminal case (Crime No.210 of 2022) originated from an FIR lodged on 04‑08‑2022 at Thally Police Station, alleging murder (IPC Sec.302) and several other offences. The petitioner, Sikkamma, mother of the detainee, filed a habeas corpus petition under Article 226 seeking the detainee’s release, alleging that the detention order was issued without a live and proximate link to the ground case and after an unexplained delay.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that the detention order was issued on 24‑09‑2022, more than a month after the remand date (04‑08‑2022), breaking the required live and proximate link between the grounds of detention and its purpose, and that the delay was unexplained. The State’s counsel contended that the delay was necessary to collect material evidence and that the order was therefore justified.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the principle laid down in Sushanta Kumar Banik v. State of Tripura, distinguishing between unreasonable and unexplained delay. It held that the present case fell within the \"unexplained delay\" category, as the State failed to justify the month‑long gap between the remand and the detention order. The Court also noted that the High Court had previously applied Banik in similar HCP matters, reinforcing the view that preventive detention must be contemporaneous with the grounds. Since preventive detention is not punitive, any procedural lapse invalidates the order. Consequently, the detention order was set aside and the detainee was ordered to be released.",

Impugned detention order has been made under  'The Tamil \nNadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootlegg ers, Cyber law \noffenders, Drug-offenders, Forest-offenders, Goondas,  Immoral traffic \noffenders, Sand-offenders, Sexual-offenders, Slum-grab bers and Video \nPage Nos.2/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nH.C.P .No.3 of 2023\nPirates Act, 1982 (Tamil Nadu Act No.14 of 1982)' [h ereinafter 'Act 14 \nof 1982' for the sake of convenience and clarity] o n the premise that \nthe detenu is a 'Goonda' within the meaning of Sect ion 2(f) of Act 14 \nof 1982.\n3.There is an adverse case. The ground case which i s the sole \nsubstratum of the impugned detention order is Crime  No.210 of 2022 \non the file of  Thally Police Station for alleged o ffences under Section \n302 of 'The Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)' [hereinafter 'IP C' for the \nsake of convenience and clarity] subsequently alter ed into one under \nSections 143, 294(b), 341, 52(A), 120(B), 302, 201 of I PC read with \n3(2)(V)  of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  (Pr evention  of \nAtrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 . Owing to the nature of the challenge \nto the impugned detention order, it is not necessar y to delve into the \nfactual matrix or be detained further by facts.\n4.  Mr.D.Balaji,  learned  counsel  on  record  for  petit ioner  and \nMr.R.Muniyapparaj, learned State Additional Public Prosecutor assisted \nby Mr.M.Sylvester John, learned counsel, for all re spondents are before \nus.\nPage Nos.3/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nH.C.P .No.3 of 2023\n5.  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  submits  that  ' live  and \nproximate  link'  between  the  grounds  of  detention  an d  purpose  of \ndetention  has  snapped  as  date  of  remand  in  the  grou nd  case  is \n04.08.2022 but the impugned detention order has bee n made only on \n24.09.2022.\n6.  Mr.R.Muniyapparaj, learned State Additional Public Prosecutor, \nsubmits to the contrary by saying that materials ha d to be collected \nand  time was consumed  for  the  same.  Considering  the  facts  and \ncircumstances of the case and nature of ground case , we find that this \nexplanation  of  learned  State  Additional  Public  Pros ecutor  is \nunacceptable.  \n7.  We  remind  ourselves  of  Sushanta  Kumar  Banik's  case \n[Sushanta Kumar Banik Vs. State of Tripura & others reporte d \nin 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 813 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1333 ].   To be \nnoted,   Banik  case law arose under  'Prevention of Illicit Traffic in \nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 198 8' [hereinafter \n'PIT NDPS Act' for the sake of brevity]  in Tirupura , wherein after \nconsidering  the  proposal  by  the  Sponsoring  Authorit y  and  after \nPage Nos.4/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nH.C.P .No.3 of 2023\nnoticing the trajectory the matter took, Hon'ble Su preme Court held \nthat the 'live and proximate link between grounds o f detention and \npurpose of detention snapping' point should be exam ined on a case to \ncase basis.  Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in Banik case law  that \nthis point has two facets.  One facet is 'unreasona ble delay' and other \nfacet is 'unexplained delay'.  We find that the cap tioned matter falls \nunder latter facet i.e.,  unexplained delay.\n8.  To be noted, Banik  case has been respectfully followed by \nthis Court in Gomathi  Vs.The Principal Secretary to Government \nand others  reported vide Neutral Citation of Madras High Court  being \n2023/MHC/334,  Sadik  Basha Yusuf Vs.

No.936 of 2021 under Article 226 seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Regional Transport Officer, Salem West, to receive his autorickshaw permit application dated 7 December 2020 and the requisite fee. The petitioner alleged that the respondent had not received his application. The respondent, through Government Advocate Mr. Annai Ezhil, produced a written instruction indicating an objection by the Salem Bus Owners Association and claimed no application had been received. The court examined the procedural posture, noting that the respondent could not be compelled to act on a non‑existent or improperly filed application. Consequently, the court declined to grant mandamus and instead directed the petitioner to re‑file the application in the prescribed format within two weeks, after which the respondent must consider it on merits within three weeks. No costs were awarded. The order emphasizes procedural compliance over substantive adjudication of the permit request.",
    "facts": "Petitioner submitted an autorickshaw permit application on 7‑Dec‑2020.

The petitioner sought a mandamus directing acceptance of the application.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the respondent’s refusal to accept the application violated his right to obtain a permit and sought a mandamus.

No. 939 of 2021 under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Regional Transport Officer (RTO), Salem West, to receive her application dated 7 December 2020 for an autorickshaw permit within a 30‑km radius of Salem Town Old Bus Stand. The petitioner alleged that despite submitting the application, the RTO had not received it. The respondent, represented by Government Advocate Mr. Annai Ezhil, produced a written instruction indicating an objection raised by the Salem Bus Owners Association and referenced a pending writ (W.P. No. 30613 of 2019) but asserted that no application had been received in the prescribed format. The Court, after considering the submissions, declined to issue mandamus. Instead, it directed the petitioner to re‑file the application in the correct format and pay the requisite fee within two weeks, after which the RTO must consider the application on its merits within three weeks. No costs were awarded. The order effectively dismissed the petition’s relief while providing a procedural pathway for the petitioner to obtain the permit.",
    "facts": "Magalakshmi submitted an application on 7‑12‑2020 for an autorickshaw permit. The RTO claimed it had not received the application and cited an objection from the Salem Bus Owners Association and a pending writ (W.P. No. 30613 of 2019). The petitioner sought a mandamus directing the RTO to accept and process the application.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the RTO’s refusal to accept the application violated her right to obtain a permit and sought a mandamus. Respondent argued that no application in the prescribed format had been received and that procedural objections and a pending writ precluded immediate acceptance.",

Vidya under Article 227 of the Constitution seeks a direction to the Principal District Munsif, Madukarai, Coimbatore, to number suit O.S.R.P. No.1045 of 2020. The petitioner contended that the lower court erred in returning the plaint on the basis of maintainability, that no appellate suit was pending, and that repeated returns were unjustified. The lower court had also held the suit non‑maintainable while a partition suit was pending. The High Court examined the material and observed that the Registry lacks statutory authority under the Civil Procedure Code or the Civil Rules of Practice to return a plaint on maintainability grounds; such questions are for the trial court. Consequently, the Court directed the Principal District Munsif to number the suit if appropriate, within a week, and disposed of the revision petition without costs. The judgment underscores the limited jurisdiction of court registries and reaffirms that maintainability issues must be decided by the trial court, not the Registry.",
    "facts": "The original suit O.S.R.P. No.1045 of 2020 was filed for partition. The Registry of the Principal District Munsif returned the plaint on alleged maintainability grounds, stating a pending appellate suit existed, which the petitioner denied. The petitioner argued the return was erroneous and sought a revision to have the suit numbered.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the Registry had no power to return the plaint on maintainability issues, that no appellate suit was pending, and that repeated returns were unjustified. The respondents (the Registry) relied on its discretion to return the plaint, citing alleged pending proceedings.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the Registry’s authority is confined to administrative functions and does not extend to substantive questions of maintainability, which are within the jurisdiction of the trial court under the Civil Procedure Code. No provision empowers the Registry to return a plaint on such grounds.

The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that\nthe lower Court failed to see that the return dated 05.11.2020\nwhich relates to the jurisdiction of the Court was explained and\nthe suit was represented and the same was accepted by the Court\nbelow. Further the lower Court stated that how this plaint is\nnot maintainable while pending suit before appellate forum,\nwherein no such suit is pending in any appellate forum. The\nCourt below failed to note that there is no justification for\nrepeated returns. Further the learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that the lower Court was in error in not taking the\nsuit on file when it is clearly stated that the defendants\nexcept one are not parties in the suit for partition which\nculminated into the second appeal. Hence, the learned counsel\nfor the petitioner prays to allow this petition.\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused\nthe materials available on record.\n4. On perusal of the records, it is seen that originally the\nsuit was filed for partition. We are constrained to observe here\nthat the Registry has no authority to return plaints of this\nnature,  questioning  the  maintainability  on  legal  provision,\nwhich can be an issue before the Trial Court alone. There is no\nprovision contemplated either under the Civil Procedure Code or\nunder the Civil Rules of Practice empowering the Registry to\nreturn the plaint on these grounds of maintainability.\n5.  The  learned  Principal  District  Munsif,  Madukarai,\nCoimbatore is called upon to instruct his Registry to number the\nsuit in O.S.R.P.No.1045 of 2020, if it is otherwise in order,\nwithin a period of one week from the date of receipt of copy of\nthis order.\n6.

Sanjay Kumar Jain, filed multiple Civil Revision Petitions (CRP Nos. 114, 137, 138, 139 of 2021) and a Civil Miscellaneous Petition (CMP No. 1293 of 2021) under Section 25 of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent) Control Act challenging judgments and decrees confirming earlier orders that fixed the monthly rent at Rs.4,500 and ordered eviction of the petitioner. The respondent, C. Arjunkumar Jain, claimed ownership of the premises and sought possession for personal occupation and business. The lower courts had previously determined the rent to be Rs.4,500 per month, directed payment of arrears, and ordered eviction when the petitioner failed to comply. The petitioner contended that the correct rent was Rs.1,000 per month and that the eviction order violated principles of natural justice by giving insufficient time to pay arrears. The High Court examined the procedural history, the findings of the Rent Controller, and the applicability of Sections 11(3) and 11(4) of the Act. It held that the rent determination was already adjudicated, the petitioner had been duly notified, and the short period to pay arrears was consistent with the statutory framework. Consequently, the Court dismissed the revision petitions, upheld the eviction order, and rejected the petition to set aside the earlier orders.",
    "facts": "The respondent purchased the property on 28-11-2011 and demanded the petitioner vacate. The petitioner claimed to pay Rs.1,000 per month, while the respondent asserted Rs.4,500 per month. Multiple eviction petitions and rent deposit petitions were filed in the Rent Controller and Rent Control Appellate Authority. The Rent Controller fixed rent at Rs.4,500, ordered arrears of Rs.2,88,000, and directed payment within a week. Non‑compliance led to eviction orders and dismissal of the petitioner’s deposit petitions. The petitioner challenged these orders in several CRPs and a CMP.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the rent was Rs.1,000 per month, that the eviction order was unsustainable without an independent rent determination, and that a one‑week deadline to pay arrears violated natural justice. Respondent argued that the Rent Controller’s determination of Rs.4,500 per month was final, that arrears were due, and that eviction was justified under the Act for personal occupation and demolition.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the Rent Controller’s determination of rent was conclusive, that the petitioner had been given notice and opportunity to pay, and that the one‑week period to settle arrears was permissible under Section 11(4) of the Act. The Court found no merit in the petitioner's claim of a lower rent and concluded that the eviction order was legally sound.",

RCOP No.54 \nof 2014 was filed under Section 8(5) of Tamil Nadu Buildings ( Lease and \nRent) Control Act for deposit of rent. \n6. Before going to the merits of the case, it is necessary to find out \nthe case of the parties.  The respondent herein/landlord filed RCOP No.24 \nof 2013 alleging that he purchased the petition mentioned proper ty from \nprevious owners Govindaraj and Krishnamurthy on 28.11.2011.  Petitione r \nwas a tenant under his previous owners for a monthly rent of Rs.4,500/- . \nAfter purchasing the property, respondent sent a notice on 09.03.2013  to the \npetitioner  demanding  attornment  of  tenancy.   Building  is  86  years  old \nbuilding  and  constructed  with  brick  and  mud  and  it  is  in  a  damaged \ncondition. Vellore Commissioner issued an order dated 13.03.2012 gra nting \n4/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\npermission to the vendors of the respondent for demolition of the  building. \nRespondent  requires  this  premises  for  his  own  occupation  for  doi ng \nbusiness in fancy and general items.  Respondent informed t he petitioner to \nvacate the premises for the reason that he requires the buildin g for his own \nuse.  The vendors  of respondent  filed  RCOP No.38  of 2008 against  the \npetitioner on the ground of wilful default and own occupation.  E viction \nwas ordered and against the order of eviction, petitioner/tena nt preferred \nRCA No.22 of 2011.  There is yet another RCA No.25 of 2011 and prese nt \neviction petition is filed without prejudice to the pendenc y of RCA Nos.22 \nof 2011 and 25 of 2011.  The petitioner/tenant filed counter sta ting that he \npaid only Rs.1,000/- as rent.  The claim that the petitioner was  paying a \nmonthly rent of Rs.4,500/- is false.   Petitioner sent notice to  the respondent \ncalling upon him to intimate about his purchase, but no rep ly was received \nfrom him.  Original landlords failed to intimate the sale in  favour of the \nrespondent.  Building is an RCC building and it is not 85 years old buildi ng. \nThe claim that the building is in a dilapiated condition is  a false statement. \nRespondent  is  doing  his  business  in  Sunnambukara  street  in  his  own \n5/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\nbuilding.   The claim that the tenanted premises is required  for his own \noccupation is not true.\n7. RCOP No.54 of 2014 was filed by the petitioner/tenant agains t \nthe respondent/landlord under Section 8(5) of Tamil Nadu Bui ldings (Lease \nand Rent) Control Act alleging that he is the tenant in respe ct of the petition \nmentioned property on a monthly rent of Rs.1,000/-.   Previous  ow ners \nGovindaraj  and  Krishnamurthy  filed  eviction  petition  on  the  gr ound  of \nwilful default and own occupation.   Petition filed by t he previous owners \nwas allowed and the petition filed by the petitioner was dismiss ed.   Against \nthe said orders, 3 Civil Revision Petitions are pending.  P etitioner deposited \nthe rents upto January 2014 in the aforesaid RCOPs in the Co urt, till the \nappeals  are  disposed  by  the  Sub-Court  on  04.02.2014.   The  rent  f rom \n01.02.2014  was  not  deposited  in  the  Court  for  the  reason  that  the  \nproceedings  were  closed.   During  the  pendency  of  the  appeals,  the \nrespondent claimed to have purchased the property.  Petiti oner sent rent for \nFebruary 2014 to the respondent, but it was refused.   Thereaf ter, petitioner \n6/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\nsent  rent  every  month  by  Money  Order.  Petitioner  issued  notic e  to \nrespondent to name a bank to deposit the monthly rent.   Respon dent failed \nto  name  the  bank.   Petitioner  sent  money  orders  from  01.02.2014  to \n30.06.2014.  Under  the  above  circumstances,  this  petition  is  filed  for \ndepositing  the rent.  Respondent/landlord  filed counter a lleging  that the \nmonthly rent  payable  for  the  building  is  Rs.4,500/-  and  not  Rs.1,000/-. \nPetitioner had not paid the rent regularly and he is a chronic  defaulter. \nTherefore, respondent/landlord  filed RCOP No.24 of 2013 for evict ion on \nthe ground of wilful default, demolition and reconstruction and for personal \noccupation.  Petitioner wilfully sent the rent as if the rent is Rs.1,000/- per \nmonth.  The tender was not proper.  Inspite of the orders of the Court, \npetitioner has not paid rent at the rate of Rs.4,500/- per month.   Therefore, \nthe petitioner is not entitled to maintain this petition.\n8. During  the  pendency  of  these  RCOPS,  respondent  filed \nI.A.No.80 of 2015 in RCOP No.24 of 2013 under Section 11(4) of Tamil  \nNadu Buildings  (Lease and Rent) Control  Act claiming that t here is an \n7/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\narrears of rent from 28.11.2011 to 28.10.2015 amounting to Rs.2,11,500/-. \nThis  was  disputed  by  the  petitioner  claiming  that  the  rent  was  only \nRs.1,000/- and there is no arrears.  Petitioner has also file d I.A.No.190 of \n2016 to decide the correct rent to be paid to the petition menti oned premises \nunder Section 11(3) of the Act.   Both these petitions were taken up for \nconsideration  and the learned  Rent Controller found  that it wa s already \ndecided by this Court that the monthly rent for the building i s Rs.4,500/- \nand inspite of clear finding with regard to the monthly rent  at Rs.4,500/- per \nmonth and direction to pay, the petitioner has not paid the rent, allowed \nI.A.No.80  of  2015  and  dismissed  I.A.No.190  of  2016.  Petitioner  was \ndirected  to  pay the  arrears  of rent  of Rs.2,88,000/-  for the  period  from \n29.11.2011 to 28.03.2017 at the rate of Rs.4,500/- per month for 64 months, \nwithin a week from the date of order.  The order was passed on 13.04.2017. \nSince the order was not complied with, further proceedings in  RCOP No.24 \nof 2013 came to be stopped and eviction was ordered.  On the sam e footing \nRCOP No.54 of 2014 came to be dismissed. RCA Nos.12 of 2017, 14 of  \n2017, 15 of 2017 and 2 of 2019 came to be filed against the orders passed in \n8/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\nRCOP  No.24  of  2013,  I.A.No.80  of  2015  in  RCOP  No.24  of  2013, \nI.A.No.190 of 2016 in RCOP No.24 of 2013 and RCOP No.54 of 2014 \nrespectively.   Learned Rent Control Appellate Authority found no reason to \ndiffer with the order passed by the learned Rent Controller  in RCOP No.24 \nof 2013, I.A.No.80 of 2015 in RCOP No.24 of 2013, I.A.No.190 of 2016 in \nRCOP No.24 of 2013 and RCOP No.54 of 2014 and confirmed the order of \nlearned  Rent  Controller  and  dismissed  the  RCAs.   Against  t he  said \ndismissal, these Civil Revision Petitions are filed.\n9. Learned  counsel  for  the petitioner/tenant  submitted  that  the  \npetitioner denies that the rent for the premises is Rs.4,500/- pe r month.  His \ncase is that the rent for the premises is only Rs.1,000/- per month.   When \nthere  is  dispute  regarding  the  quantum  of  rent  and  when  it  is  not \nindependently decided in RCOP No.24 of 2013 or RCOP No.54 of 2014,  \ndirection to pay the rent at the rate of Rs.4,500/- per month in  Section 11(4) \npetition and on failure to pay the amount, ordering eviction is  unsustainable \nin law.   Not only that the petitioner was not given suffici ent opportunity to \n9/17\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nC.R.P.(NPD) Nos.114, 137, 138 and 139 of 2021\nand\nC.M.P.No.1293 of 2021\npay the arrears.  Only a week's time was given for paying the arrears of rent \nto the tune of Rs.2,88,000/-.  This is contrary to the principle s of natural \njustice and law.   Therefore, the order of learned Rent Contro ller fixing the \nmonthly rent at Rs.4,500/- on the basis of the common order passed in CRP \n(NPD) Nos.955, 956, 957 and 958 of 2014 and ordering eviction and the \npetitioner's failure to pay the arrears of rent within a short time i s not correct \nand endorsing this order by the learned Rent Control Appella te Authority is \nalso not correct.   Therefore, he prays for setting aside the orders of learned \nRent Control Appellate Authority and for dismissing the evict ion petition \nand allowing the petition filed to deposit the rent.  \n10.

The petition was filed under Sections 222 and 276 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. No advocate or the petitioner appeared before the Court on the hearing dates, including the last hearing on 01‑02‑2022. The Court inferred that the petitioner was not interested in prosecuting the petition. Consequently, the Court dismissed the petition for non‑prosecution, as per the order dated 04‑02‑2022 signed by Justice Abdul Quddhos. The judgment underscores the procedural requirement that a petitioner must actively prosecute a petition for probate; failure to do so results in dismissal irrespective of the substantive merits. No substantive arguments or precedents were cited. The order was certified as a true copy by the Assistant Registrar. This case illustrates the Court’s strict adherence to procedural discipline in probate matters under the Indian Succession Act.",

    "summary": "On 21 January 2022, the Madras High Court, sitting as a single judge, heard Civil Revision Petition No. 73 of 2022 filed by M/s. Hazrath Baquer‑E‑Agha Dargah & Endowment (Hazrath Baqar Aga Dargah Wakf) represented by its President/Muthavalli, Dr. G.S.M.P. Khadri, under Article 227 of the Constitution. The petitioner sought a direction to the Tamil Nadu Wakf Tribunal, Chennai, to dispose of an interim injunction application (IA No. 621/2021) pending in OS No. 37/2021 at the earliest possible date. The respondents, the Tamil Nadu Wakf Board (through its CEO) and Mrs. M. Shenbagavalli, were not required to be served notice due to the limited scope of the prayer. The Court examined the note‑papers, observed that the first respondent had already been heard and the matter was posted for enquiry by the second respondent. Considering the nature of the application as an injunction, the Court directed the Wakf Tribunal to dispose of IA No. 621/2021 within four weeks of receipt of the order. Consequently, the Civil Revision Petition was allowed without costs. The judgment underscores the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 to ensure expeditious disposal of pending applications before subordinate tribunals.",

The petitioner argued that the delay in disposal was prejudicial to its interests. The respondents, the Wakf Board and Mrs. Shenbagavalli, were parties to the underlying dispute but were not required to be served notice for this limited prayer.",
    "arguments": "The petitioner contended that the Wakf Tribunal had unduly delayed the hearing of IA No. 621/2021 and that a direction from the High Court was necessary to ensure timely justice. The respondents did not file any substantive objection to the prayer, and the record indicated that the first respondent had already been heard while the second respondent’s matter was pending enquiry.",

    "summary": "The petitioners E. Mani, E. Raghupathy and E. Ashokan filed a review application (Writ No. 137 of 2021) challenging the Division Bench order dated 16 August 2021 in W.P. No. 16814 of 2021. The original writ sought a mandamus directing various revenue officials to remove encroachments on temple land in Nallur village, Kanchipuram district, and to re‑classify the land and issue a patta. The Division Bench allowed the temple to erect a compound wall and directed the authorities to consider re‑classification after giving parties an opportunity, but it did not dispose of the petitioners’ substantive relief. The petitioners argued that the Division Bench had not issued notice to the review applicants and that the order was erroneous. The respondents contended that the order was clear, contained no adverse finding against them, and that no error was apparent on the face of the record. The High Court, after examining the order, found no adverse language toward the review applicants and observed that the Division Bench had acted within its jurisdiction. Since no error was evident, the Court held that a review could not be entertained and dismissed the review application without costs, closing the connected writ petitions.",

DURAISWAMY, J.)\nThe respondents 6 to 8 in the writ petition in W.P.\nNo.16814 of 2021, have filed the above Review Application, to\nreview the order passed in the said writ petition on 16.08.2021.\n2. The first respondent herein/writ petitioner filed the\nwrit  petition  to issue a  Writ of Mandamus,  directing the\nofficial respondents 1 to 5 therein, to remove the encroachments\nmade by the Review Applicants in the temple land in S. No.1C/1\nsituated  at  Nallur  Village,  Kundrathur  Taluk,  Kancheepuram\nDistrict  and  consequently for a direction to the  District\nRevenue Officer, Kancheepuram District to pass an order with\nregard to classification of the temple land and for the issuance\nof patta, based on the proceedings of the Fit Person/Executive\nOfficer of the temple dated 13.07.2021.\n3. The Division Bench of this court, by order dated\n16.08.2021, after taking into consideration the case of the\nfirst  respondent/writ petitioner and the learned Government\ncounsel  appearing  for  the  District  Collector  and  the  Fit\nPerson/Executive  Officer,  disposed  of  the  writ  petition\nobserving that, even the trespassers cannot be dispossessed,\nwithout  following  the  due  process  of  law.  Since  it  was\nrepresented before the Division Bench that attempts are being\nmade to encroach upon the temple property, the Division Bench,\nthought it appropriate to permit the temple to put up a compound\nwall  in  order  to  safeguard  the  said  property.  In  such\ncircumstances, the Division Bench directed the temple to start\nconstructing a compound wall on 23.08.2021 in and around the\nsaid property and further directed the sixth respondent/police\nto give appropriate police protection for raising the compound\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nwall in respect of the subject property and to continue the\nprotection till the completion of the construction.\n4. In respect of reclassification of the land and for\nissuance of patta, the Division Bench, directed the authorities\nto consider the request of the temple and pass orders at the\nearliest, after giving sufficient opportunity to the parties\nconcerned.\n5. Mr.J.Sathiyamoorthy, learned counsel appearing for the\napplicants submitted that the Division Bench disposed of the\nwrit petition, without issuing notice to the Review Applicants. \n6. On a reading of the order passed by the Division Bench,\nit is clear that the Division Bench has not stated a single word\nadverse to the Review Applicants. In order to protect the\nproperty of the temple, the Division Bench directed the temple\nauthorities to put up a compound wall in and around the subject\nproperty. Even for the reclassification and for issuance of\npatta, the authorities were directed to pass orders only after\ngiving sufficient opportunity to the parties concerned. Hence we\nare of the considered view that the Review Applicants cannot\nhave any grievance as against the order passed by the Division\nBench in the writ petition.\n7. That apart, we do not find any error apparent on the\nface  of  the record, warranting  interference in the  Review\nApplication. Unless there is an error apparent on the face of\nthe record, the Review application cannot be entertained. In\nsuch view of the matter, we are not inclined to entertain the\nReview Application.\n8.  Accordingly,  the  Review  Application  is  dismissed.\nHowever, there is no order as to costs. Consequently, the\nconnected writ miscellaneous petitions are closed.\n                              Sd/-\n     Assistant Registrar(CS III)\n//True Copy//\n     Sub Assistant Registrar\nAsr\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nTo\n1.

    "summary": "The application (A.No.27 of 2022) was filed by the 2nd respondent, who is the personal guarantor of a loan taken by the 1st respondent company, seeking to reject O.P.No.486 of 2016 filed by the State Financial Corporation. The corporation claimed that a foreclosure notice was issued on 30‑Oct‑1996, the mortgaged property was taken over on 9‑Jun‑1999, and the property was sold by M/s TIIC, releasing Rs.1,06,80,388 on 24‑Nov‑2011. The guarantor argued that the personal guarantee could be invoked only within three years of the sale proceeds, making the 2016 petition time‑barred. The corporation contended that the limitation for invoking a personal guarantee is three years, but the limitation for actions against the company is twelve years, and thus the petition should not be dismissed. The court examined the statutory provisions, noted that the guarantee was invoked five years after the sale, and relied on Supreme Court precedent that the three‑year period is mandatory. Consequently, the application was allowed and the original petition was rejected as barred by limitation.",
    "facts": "1. The State Financial Corporation (first respondent) issued a foreclosure notice on 30‑Oct‑1996 and took over mortgaged assets on 9‑Jun‑1999. 2. The assets were handed to M/s TIIC, which sold the properties and released Rs.1,06,80,388 on 24‑Nov‑2011 to the corporation. 3. The 2nd respondent, a personal guarantor for the loan, filed an application in 2022 under Sections 31(1)(aa) and 32(11) of the State Financial Corporation Act seeking to reject O.P.No.486 of 2016, arguing that the guarantee could not be invoked after the three‑year limitation period. 4. The corporation filed O.P.No.486 of 2016 to invoke the personal guarantee five years after the 2011 sale.",
    "arguments": "Applicant/2nd respondent: The personal guarantee must be invoked within three years of the event (sale proceeds on 24‑Nov‑2011); the 2016 petition is therefore time‑barred. Relied on Supreme Court judgment (2006(4) CTC 89) affirming the three‑year limitation. Respondent/first respondent: No dispute on the three‑year limitation for personal guarantees, but argued that the limitation for actions against the corporation is twelve years, making the cited precedent inapplicable and the petition should not be dismissed.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court held that Section 31(1)(aa) of the State Financial Corporation Act is not a mode of execution of a decree but a statutory remedy subject to the Limitation Act. The personal guarantee, being a contractual right, is governed by the three‑year limitation period under Articles 136 and 137 of the Limitation Act. Since the corporation received the sale proceeds on 24‑Nov‑2011, the guarantee should have been invoked by 24‑Nov‑2014. The petition filed in 2016 exceeded this period, making it barred by limitation. The Supreme Court precedent cited by the applicant was deemed applicable, leading to the rejection of the original petition.",

The  applicant  is  the  2nd respondent  in  the  main  O.P.  and  he  is  the \nguarantor to the loan.  He has filed the present application  to  reject the main \noriginal  petition  in  O.P.No.486  of  2016  stating  that  to  invoke  the  per sonal \nguarantee, there is a limitation of 3 years and therefore  beyond that, the personal \nguarantee cannot be invoked which is barred by limitation. \n3. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant/2nd respondent submitted \nthat the first respondent/petitioner in the petition itself a verred that foreclosure \nnotice was issued on 30.10.1996  and the mortgaged property was taken over on \n09.06.1999.   The  petitioner  corporation,  on  08.10.2009,  handed  over  the \nmortgaged property to M/s.TIIC being the pari passu holder, who in turn sold the \n1/5\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.No.27 of 2022 in O.P.No.486 of 2016\nproperties and on 24.11.2011 released  a sum of Rs.1,06,80,388/- from an d out of \nsale proceeds to the petitioner Corporation. The learned couns el further submitted \nthat it is to be noted that from that day i.e. 24.11.2011 within 3 years the personal \nguarantee  should have been invoked whereas, the present petition has been f iled in \nthe  year  2016  which  is  after  the  lapse  of  5  years.  Therefore ,  it  is  barred  by \nlimitation and he has placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Suprem Court \nreported  in  2006(4)  CTC  89  (Maharashtra  State  Financial  Corporation  vs.  \nAshok K.Agarwal and others)  in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the \nperiod of limitation for  invoking  personal guarantee is 3 yea rs and as per the \nArticle 136 and  137 of the Limitation Act,, the application to invoke personal \nguarantee for recovery of short fall amount is barred by limi tation. The application \nunder Section 31 and 32 of the State Financial Corporation Act,  is  not  the way of \nexecution of a decree or order of any civil suit. Therefore, the  petition is beyond \nthe period of limitation of 3 years and hence the main origi nal petition has to be \nrejected. \n4. The learned Counsel for the first respondent/petitioner  w ould submit that \nthere is no quarrel with reference to the proposition of l aw that invoking personal \n2/5\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.No.27 of 2022 in O.P.No.486 of 2016\nguarantee, the period of limitation is 3 years whereas, agains t the company, it is 12 \nyears.  Therefore,  the  citations  referred  to  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \napplicant/2nd respondent is not applicable to the present case and the appl ication is \nliable to be dismissed. \n5. Heard and perused the records.\n6. Admittedly the applicant/2nd respondent is the personal guarantor for the \nloan  availed  by  the  second  respondent/1st respondent  company.  The  first \nrespondent/Corporation is a deemed Financial Corporation w ithin the meaning of \nthe  Section  46(1)  of  the  State  Financial  Corporations  Act,  1951.  Since  the \napplicant company committed default in repaying the loan, foreclo sure  notice was \nissued  and  the  assets  of  the  company  were  also  taken  over  by  the  first \nrespondent/petitioner  and  handed  over  to  M/s.TIIC.  The  mortgaged  pr operties \nwere sold by the 5th respondent/TIIC and released a sum of Rs.1,06,80,388/- on \n24.11.2011 to the first respondent/petitioner. Thereafter, the  first respondent filed \nthe petition in O.P.No.486 of 2016 under Section 31(1) (aa) of the  State Financial \nCorporation Act  invoking the personal guarantee after the laps e of five years. \n3/5\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nA.No.27 of 2022 in O.P.No.486 of 2016\nEven a bare reading of the averment in the petition itself shows  that the petitioner \nreceived  the  pro-rata  share  from  the  sale  proceeds  from  the  M/s.T IIC   on \n24.11.2011 itself. The first respondent/petitioner should have fil ed the petition to \ninvoke  personal  guarantee  under  section  31  (1)  (aa)  of  the  State  Financial \nCorporations Act, 1951, within 3 years, whereas, it has been fil ed only in the year \n2016 which is beyond limitation. Therefore the main original petition is liable to be \nrejected on the ground of limitation.\n7.

    "summary": "The petitioner, M.K.Balu, filed W.P. No.3195 of 2021 seeking a writ of mandamus under Article 226 directing the State of Tamil Nadu and associated agencies to consider his representation dated 25‑12‑2020 and to prevent obstruction of a 35‑foot public pathway (5th Lane) connecting Ambattur Industrial Estate with Mogappair Road. The pathway runs under a high‑tension power corridor and is claimed to have been used for over 40 years. Respondents 4 and 8 allegedly erected a wall obstructing the road. The petitioner argued that the pathway is a public right of way, that the respondents are estopped from altering it, and that illegal construction under the high‑tension lines must be removed. The State agencies contended that the petitioner’s representation was not in compliance with Section 80A of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, and that the matter falls within their appellate jurisdiction. They also relied on earlier judgments (W.P. No.27090/2003, W.P. No.13940/2006) which upheld the allotment of the plot to the seventh respondent and dismissed similar petitions. The Court held that the pathway is not a legally recognised public road in the layout, the petitioner’s claim lacks statutory backing, and earlier orders preclude further relief. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed.",
    "facts": "The Government of Tamil Nadu constructed labor tenements in Ambattur Industrial Estate. Under various government orders, these tenements were to be sold to original allottees. Plot OP‑No.7, part of a common‑purpose area, was allotted to a seventh respondent and later purchased by the eighth respondent, who began construction despite a high‑tension power line overhead. The petitioner and other residents use a 35‑foot road (5th Lane) beneath the power line as a public pathway. On 24‑12‑2000 respondents 4 and 8 attempted to build a wall obstructing this pathway. The petitioner filed a representation on 25‑12‑2020 requesting removal of the illegal construction and preservation of the pathway. The respondents denied the allegations, citing procedural deficiencies and prior court orders.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner: The pathway is a long‑standing public right of way; respondents 4 and 8 are estopped from obstructing it; construction under high‑tension lines is illegal; the State must act under its statutory duties. Respondents: The petitioner’s representation does not comply with Section 80A of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act; the pathway is not a legally defined road in the layout; earlier judgments have already upheld the allotment of the plot and dismissed similar claims; the matter falls within the appellate authority of the State agencies.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the statutory framework, noting that Section 80A requires representations to follow a specific procedure, which the petitioner failed to observe. It reviewed prior judgments (W.P. No.27090/2003 and W.P. No.13940/2006) that affirmed the validity of the plot allotment and rejected claims of a public pathway. The Court found no evidence that the 35‑foot lane is a designated public road in the official layout, rendering the petitioner’s claim untenable. Consequently, the Court concluded that the writ petition lacks merit and cannot be entertained.",

The tenements allotted were maintained from\n1966-1980 by the Managing Committee for the Industrial Housing\nDepartment of the Industries and Commerce. Under a tripartite\nagreement, the employer agreed to deduct the rent and other\ncharges from the wages of the allottees. By G.O.(Ms).No.128,\nHousing and Urban Development Department dated 24.03.1997, the\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu decided to sell the tenement to the\nallottees  and  by  the  G.O.(Ms).No.58  Housing  and  Urban\nDevelopment Department dated 01.02.2000, the Government decided\nto sell the tenements to the original allottees and legal heirs\nof the original allottees. \n2(b).The respondents 2 and 3 allotted Plot in OP.No.7 to\nthe 7th respondent and kept the same in abeyance as the same\noriginally  fell  under  the  common  purpose  area.  In  the\nW.P.No.27090 of 2003, filed by the 7th respondent, this Court, by\nthe order dated 19.11.2004, directed the respondents 2 and 3 to\nhand over the vacant possession to the 7th respondent. The\nrespondents 2 and 3 filed W.A.No.1933 of 2005 and this Court, by\nthe order dated 07.11.2005, dismissed the said Writ Appeal.\n2(c).For all the tenements, the pathway to reach adjacent\narea was across High Tension Power Corridor, which runs through\n35 feet road connecting First main road of Ambattur Industrial\nEstate to the Mogappair Road of Satya Nagar, Padi. In the year\n2006, the petitioner and the others were informed that the said\npathway is going to be closed. After giving a representation\ndated  29.03.2006,  the  residents,  through  their  Thozhilalar\nKudiyiruppor Nala Sangam, filed W.P.No.13940 of 2006, praying\nthat  Plot  in  OP  No.7  should  not  be  allotted  to  the  7th\nrespondent. This Court dismissed the said Writ Petition by the\norder dated 04.08.2006. The 7th respondent admitted in the legal\nnotice dated 01.04.2006 that there is a lamp post and there is a\nHigh Tension  wire passing through the Plot OP.No.7 and there is\na 20 feet Thar Road. \n2(d).The 8th respondent purchased the Plot OP.No.7 from the\n7th respondent in the year 2020. The 8th respondent has made\nconstruction. There cannot be any construction under the High\nTension lines. The land occupied by the 8th respondent was\noriginally  allotted  for  common  purpose.  The  8th respondent\npurchased the Plot OP No.7 with pathway and allowed High Tension\nline to continue. \n2(e).35 feet of the road is being continuously used by all\nthe residents in the surrounding areas, which is also the road\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nconnecting the 8th  respondent Plot in OP No.7. It is submitted\nthat on 24.12.2000, suddenly the respondents 4 and 8 attempted\nto construct a wall obstructing the pathway measuring 35 feet\nwidth which is connecting the first main road of Ambattur\nIndustrial Estate with Mogappair Road of Satya Nagar, Padi. When\nmembers of the Association objected, the respondents 4 and 8\ngave a false complaint to the Police. Due to the influence of\nthe respondents 4 and 8, the residents were threatened and\ninformed that the respondents 4 and 8 can construct a wall\nacross the pathway which is in existence for more than 40 years.\nThe respondents 4 and 8 are trying to alter the road by\nconstructing wall, obstructing 35 feet road connecting first\nmain road of Ambattur Industrial Estate with Mogappair Road of\nSatya  Nagar,  Padi.  The  respondents  4  and  8 are  bound  by\nprinciples of estoppel as the existence of road cited as a\nreason for execution of the sale deed in favour of the 7th\nrespondent. \n2(f).The petitioner made a representation dated 25.12.2020\nto the respondents 1 to 5, requesting to take steps to remove\nthe illegal construction under the High Tension Corridor (HT)\nwhich runs above the developed Plot in OP No.7, South Phase, 5th\nLane, First Main Road of Ambattur Industrial Estate, Chennai and\nrespondents 1 to 3 to ensure that the said pathway is not\nobstructed by the respondents 4 and 8. The respondents received\nthe same, but have not taken any action. Hence, the petitioner\nhas come out with the present Writ Petition. \n3.The 1st respondent filed counter affidavit and denied all\nthe averments made by the petitioner. Mr.S.Arumugam, learned\nGovernment Advocate appearing for the 1st respondent submitted\nthat  as  far  as  removal  of  unauthorized  constructions  and\nencroachments are concerned, as per the provisions of the Tamil\nNadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, the 1st respondent is\nan appellate authority. The petitioner, in paragraph no.14 of\nthe affidavit has stated that he has submitted representation to\nthe 1st respondent. The said representation is not as per Section\n80 A of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971\nnamely the appeal powers conferred on 6th respondent. Whenever a\nrepresentation is received for removal of illegal construction,\nthe same will be forwarded to the competent authority to take\nappropriate action in accordance with law. \n4(a).The 3rd respondent filed counter affidavit on behalf of\nthe respondents 2 and 3 and denied all the averments made by the\npetitioner. Mr.S.P.Prabhakaran, learned counsel appearing for\nthe respondents 2 and 3 submitted that the Writ Petition is not\nmaintainable. The labor tenements were constructed by the Tamil\nNadu Government with the aid of the Central Government for the\nbenefit of economically weaker sections of the community in the\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\npublic  and  private  sectors.  Originally,  the  tenements  were\nallotted on rental basis. Subsequently, the State Government, by\nG.O.(Ms.)No.128, Housing and Urban Development Department dated\n24.03.1997, took a policy decision to sell the labor tenements\nto  the  original  allottees  or  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased\nallottees. The allotments to weaker section of the community\nwere  unauthorizedly  transferred  to  other  persons  without\napproval of TANSIDCO. On verification, it was found that 46\npersons,  including  the  petitioner  are  unauthorizedly  in\noccupation of the tenements. As per the instruction in Express\nMemo  No.15437/IE-5/2002-1  dated  10.10.2019  issued  by  the\nTANSIDCO Head Office, proceedings were initiated under the Tamil\nNadu Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act\n1975 and Form – A and Form B notices were issued and after\nenquiry,  eviction  was  ordered.  The  petitioner,  instead  of\nvacating the tenement No. 71, filed W.M.P.No.31947 of 2019 in\nW.P.No.31743 of 2019 and the said W.M.P. is still pending before\nthis Court. \n4(b).Plot in OP.No.7 was allotted to the 7th respondent on\noutright  basis.  The  7th respondent  paid  the  entire  sale\nconsideration, but sale deed was not executed and possession was\nnot handed over to the 7th respondent. Hence, 7th respondent filed\nW.P.No.27090 of 2003. As per the orders of this Court dated\n04.08.2006 made in W.P.No.13940 of 2006, the sale deed was\nexecuted in favour of the 7th respondent and possession was\nhanded over to the 7th respondent. The 2nd respondent gave “No\nObjection Certificate” to the Building Plan for the proposed\nconstruction of the building in the Plot in OP. No.7. The\nGovernment,  in  G.O.(Ms).No.155  MSME  (C)  Department  dated\n13.11.2009, ratified the allotment of the Developed Plot in\nOP.No.7  allotted to the 7th respondent. The petitioner, as\npresident  of  Thozhilalar  Kudiyiruppor  Nala  Sangam  filed\nW.P.No.13940 of 2006 against the respondents 1 to 3 herein for\nWrit of Mandamus, forbearing the respondents from allotting the\nland under the High Tension Power Corridor adjoining D Block of\nthe Labor tenements at Ambattur Industrial Estate, Chennai 58 to\nany one else or put the same for use of any other purpose on the\nground that the members of the Thozhilalar Kudiyiruppor Nala\nSangam are all using the same as a pathway for their ingress and\negress to the tenements across the High Tension Power Corridor\nand  members  of  the  said  Sangam  came  to   know  that  the\nrespondents 1 to 3 are going to allot the pathway to third\nparties. This Court, taking note of its order dated 19.11.2004\nmade  in W.P.No.27090 of 2003 filed by the 7th respondent,\ndismissed the Writ Petition as allotment of Plot in OP.No.7 to\n7th respondent was upheld by this Court. \n4(c).All the roads formed by the TANSIDCO/the 2nd respondent\nherein are internal roads and there is no access earmarked in\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nthe lay out allotted by the petitioner. The W.P.No.13940 of 2006\nfiled by the petitioner as President of Thozhilalar Kudiyiruppor\nNala Sangam for Mandamus for similar relief was dismissed by\nthis Court on 04.08.2006. The petitioner cannot claim a pathway,\nwhich is mentioned as road to connect Mogappair Road of Satya\nNagar, Padi with Ambattur Industrial Estate, as there is no such\npathway in Ambattur Industrial Estate layout. The petitioner and\noccupants of the tenements were unauthorizedly using",

Anuradha was terminated in 1981 on allegations of falsifying student community records; the termination was later set aside by a statutory appellate authority, which ordered reinstatement with back wages. The school failed to comply, instead obtaining a stay and later appointing her to another school without paying arrears. The trial court held the school jointly liable with the education department officials. The appellant argued that the school is merely a dispersing authority, not a fee‑levying institution, and that the limitation period barred the suit. The High Court examined the legality of the termination, the effect of the reinstatement order, and the applicability of limitation. It concluded that the school’s refusal to obey the reinstatement order rendered it personally liable for the arrears, but that liability should be confined to the school alone, not the government officials. Consequently, the decree was modified to restrict liability to the first defendant only, partially allowing the appeal.",
    "facts": "Anuradha was employed as a clerk in the school in 1967 under the Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation Act. In 1981 she was suspended and later terminated for allegedly altering students' caste certificates. She challenged the termination before a statutory appellate authority, which set aside the dismissal and ordered reinstatement with back wages. The school ignored the order, obtained a stay, and later appointed her to another school without paying arrears. Anuradha filed a suit for recovery of Rs.47,772 with interest. The trial court awarded the amount against the school and two government officials. The school appealed, contending lack of liability and limitation defence.",
    "arguments": "Appellant (school) argued: (1) It is a non‑fee‑levying, dispersing authority and cannot be held jointly liable with the State; (2) The suit is barred by the three‑year limitation as the cause of action arose in 1986; (3) During suspension and after reinstatement, no back wages are payable under the work‑no‑pay principle. Respondent (Anuradha) argued: (1) The termination was illegal and the reinstatement order, though partially complied with, obliges the school to pay arrears for the period of unlawful suspension; (2) The school’s refusal to obey the order makes it personally liable; (3) The limitation period is tolled by the pending writ petition and the appellate order.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the termination was illegal and the appellate authority’s reinstatement order was binding. The school’s failure to implement the order amounted to a breach of statutory duty, rendering it personally liable for back wages. The limitation defence was rejected because the cause of action accrued after the appellate order and was not barred by the pending writ petition. However, the liability of the two government officials was dismissed as they were not parties to the illegal termination. Hence, the decree was limited to the school alone.",

The brief facts of the case necessary for deciding this \nAppeal is as follows:-\nOne B.Anuradha wife of P.Balasubramaniam was employed as a \nClerk in the Appellant School during the month of October 1967. \nHer service was governed by Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation \nAct and Rules.  When there was change of Correspondent to the \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nschool, the new correspondent with ulterior motive to appoint \nhis own relatives, started harassing the staff members making \nfalse allegation against them.  The plaintiff Anuradha, was \ncharged for furnishing false entry regarding community of the \nstudents. In spite of proper explanation, she was terminated \nfrom service without affording proper opportunity. The said \ntermination order was challenged as arbitrary and illegal before \nthe statutory authority, who is the 2nd defendant. \n(ii).  The  Appeal  preferred  against  the  illegal \ntermination was allowed by the 2nd defendant vide order dated \n26.10.1982 with a direction to the Management to reinstate the \nplaintiff with backwages and continuity of service.  In spite of \norder passed by the Appellate Authority, same was not given \neffect by the Management, but they preferred W.P.No.5609 of 1983 \nbefore the High Court challenging the order passed by the \nAppellate  Authority  and  obtained  exparte  stay.   Then  the \nplaintiff filed separate W.P.No.12842 of 1984 for implementation \nof the reinstatement order passed by the 2nd defendant. The said \nwrit petition was allowed directing the 2  & 3 defendants namely \nJoint Director of School Education and State of Tamil Nadu \nrepresented  by  Commissioner  and  Secretary  to  Government, \nEducation Department. To post her in any other institute. \nAccordingly  she  was  employed  in  a  different  school  on \n05.06.1985.  However, her pay and allowance during the period of \nsuspension,  till  reinstatement  was  not  paid.   Hence, \nrepresentation was given to pay the arrears.  The Management \nfailed to pay the arrears for the period she was illegally put \nunder suspension. Hence, after issuing notice under Section 80 \nof C.P.C, the suit for recovery of Rs.47,772/- with 18 % \ninterest was laid.  The statement of account for the said amount \nwas annexed with the plaint.  \n3. The 1st Appellant in their written statement contested \nthe suit stating that the plaintiff was charged for changing the \ncaste name of the students with ulterior motive. When same came \nto the notice of the management, she was asked to show cause why \naction should not be taken for her grave mis-conduct. Her \nexplanation was not satisfactory so, she was placed under \nsuspension. After conducting enquiry, she was terminated her \nfrom service, as per Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation \nfollowing the principle of natural justice.  However, in the \nappeal preferred by the plaintiff, the 2nd dependant without \nproper appreciation of the facts and the illegality committed by \nthe  plaintiff,  set  aside  the  dismissal  order and  issued \ndirection to reinstate her from service.  In any event based on \nwork no pay principle for the suspension period, till the \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nreinstatement, the plaintiff is not entitled for backwages. She \nhad  been  provided  posting  in  other  institute  following \nG.O.Ms.No.1664/1978  therefore,  there  is  nothing  for  the \nplaintiff to claim.  \n4.  In the additional written statement filed by the 1st \ndefendant, plea of limitation was raised. It was contended that \nthe plaintiff was suspended from service on 29.01.1981 and same \nwas  setaside  by  the  2nd defendant  Appellate  Authority  on \n28.10.1982.  The stay granted in the Writ Petition filed by the \nManagement was in force only upto 07.07.1983. The limitation \nperiod for recovery of money is 3 years, therefore, the suit \nought to have been filed on or before 06.07.1986. Whereas, the \nplaint was presented only on 28.04.1987 therefore, the suit is \nhopelessly barred by limitation.\n5. In the written statement filed by the 2nd respondent, the \nliability to pay the suit amount was denied and it was contended \nthat having found that the plaintiff was terminated illegality \nwithout proper opportunity, the termination order has been duly \nsetaside and same is under challenged by way of Writ Petition \nfiled by the Management. Therefore, the money suit for recovery \nof backwages is pre-matured.\n6. The Trial Court, on considering the pleadings framed the \nfollowing issues and additional issues:-\n1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim the sum \nof Rs.47,712/- or any other sum against the first defendant or \nthe other defendants?\n2. Whether the suit is bad for misjoinder of first \ndefendant?\n3. Whether the suit as framed is maintainable?\n4. To what other reliefs the parties are entitled to?\nAdditional Issues:-\n1. Whether the first defendant has to pay the plaintiff \nas per G.O. Passed in G.O.Ms.No.1664/1978?\n2. Whether the suit is barred by limitation?\n7. Before the Trial Court, one witness on behalf of the \nplaintiff and one witness on behalf of the defendant were \nexamined. 28 Exhibits were marked in support of the plaint and \none Exhibit was marked on behalf of the defendant.\n8. The Trial Court, on appreciation of evidence, allowed the \nsuit passed by the Trial Court directing the defendants 1 to 3 \nto pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs.47,772/- with 18% interest from \nthe date of plaint till the date of realisation.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n9. The Management has preferred the present appeal on the \nground that the Trial Court failed to appreciate the facts \nproperly.  The Appellant being a non-fees levying School running \nwith the aid of the State cannot be jointly and severally held \nliable to pay the staff members.  The Appellant is only a \ndispersing Authority. Hence, Trial Court should have dismissed \nthe suit as against the appellant.  As far as the conduct of the \nplaintiff,  stating  that  she  has  altered  the  community \ncertificate  of  the  students  illegally  and  when  the  said \nmisconduct came to light, appropriate charges were framed and \nenquiry was conducted in accordance with law. Having found that \nshe has committed serious misconduct, termination order was \nissued. During the suspension period, till the reinstatement \nperiod, the Management is not under the legal obligation to pay \nthe salary. If at all she is entitled for any backwages and \nattender charges, it is the other defendants namely Joint \nDirector of School Education and the State alone is liable. \nUnder  the  Regulation  Act,  it  is  suffice  to  intimate  the \nAuthorities about the termination of the staff paid under the \ngrant.  Furthermore, there is no obligation on the part of the \nmanagement.  While so, holding the management for backwages is \nnot in consonance with law. Therefore, the Trial Court ought to \nhave exonerated the management.  The statement furnished by the \nplaintiff is annexed to the plaint is not substantiated by any \nevidence. The self serving statement ought not to have been \nrelied by the Trial Court.\n10. On considering the pleadings, this Court formulated the \nfollowing point for determination:-\n(i).  Whether  the  Appellant  is  entitled  for  any \nexoneration from liability? \n(ii). Whether the suit is barred by limitation?\n(iii). Whether the pendency of Writ Petition will save \nthe limitation?\n11. The specific case of the plaintiff is that she was \nappointed in the Appellant School in the year 1967.  The new \ncorrespondent in order to replace them with his own relative, \nfrivolous charges were framed against the staff as one of the \nvictim, is the plaintiff.  The specific charge against her was \nthat, she has altered the caste of some people.  The enquiry \nconducted by the Management leading to termination of service \nfound  to  be  illegal  and  the  Statutory  Authority  ordered \nreinstatement with backwages.  Against this order the Appellant \nherein has not preferred any further Appeal before the Tribunal \nconstituted under the Tamil Nadu Private School Regulation Act, \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\ninstead, they filed a writ petition before the High Court and \nobtained an interim order.  The plaintiff was forced to file a \nWrit Petition for implementation of reinstatement order passed \nby the 2nd defendant. Pursuant to the order passed in her writ \npetition, the defendants 2 & 3 had provided her appointment in \nan alternate School. The order of reinstatement passed by the 2nd \ndefendant has come to a logical end after dismissal of the writ \npetition filed by the Management. When there is no further \nappeal reversing the reinstatement order, mere reinstatement of \nthe plaintiff in a different school without payment of arrears \nis only partial compliance of the order.  The backwages during \nthe period of suspension till reinstatement ought to be paid. \nWhether the liability to pay should be fastened on all the \ndefendants as ordered by the Trial Court are only against the \nManagement is the point to be decided.  \n12. The evidence placed before this Court clearly shows that \nthe termination order passed by the Appellant herein is without \naffording fair opportunity. Same has been held to be illegal and \nset-aside  by  the  2nd defendant.   Despite  the  order  of \nreinstatement, the said order was not obeyed only pursuant to \nthe order passed  by this Court in a writ petition filed by the \nplaintiff, the defendants 2 & 3 has provided her alternate \nappointment. There cannot be any liability fastened on the \ndefendants 2 & 3 for paying the backwages.  If the Management \nhas complied the order passed by the 2nd defendant by reinstating \nher in their own institute, the stand taken by the Appellant \nherein that they are not liable to pay the arrears may carry \nsome merit. When they have totally disobeyed the order of the 2nd \ndefendant, despite the order of reinstatement, the liability to \npay the plaintiff for the period of non-service become the \npersonal liability of the Management which has mal-administer \nits affairs with ulterior motive defying the principle of \nnatural justice.  Therefore, this Court is of the view that the \ndecree passed by this Court as against all the defendants ought \nto be restricted only against the 1st  defendant, who is the \nappellant herein.  \n13. The defendants 2 & 3 has preferred a separate appeal \nchallenging the order of the Trial Court fastening liability on \nthem jointly and severally. \n14. The Learned Counsel for the respondent/plaintiff would \nsubmitted  that  in  the  order  passed  by  this  Court  in \nC.M.P.Nos.4677, 9235 and 9840 of 1993 dated 25.08.1993, the \nappellant was directed to deposit 50% of the decree amount \ntogether with costs and out of it 50% was permitted to be \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nwithdrawn.  Accordingly, the plaintiff/1st respondent withdrew \n50%.  Thereafter, Letter Patent Appeal LPA. No.216 of 1995 was \nfiled before the Division Bench by the plaintiff/respon",

The prosecution alleged that the accused strangled Perarasi over a dowry‑related demand of Rs.2,00,000, invoking Sections 498‑A, 304‑B and 302 IPC. Evidence comprised the victim’s post‑mortem report indicating asphyxia by strangulation, a recovered 30‑ft string, and testimonies of close relatives (Ramu, Lakshmi and Renganathan). The trial court found the evidence insufficient, especially the lack of any direct link between the alleged monetary demand and the marriage, and acquitted the accused. On appeal, the High Court examined the same material, noting that the prosecution’s case rested solely on family testimony without corroboration, that the alleged demand was unrelated to dowry, and that the string’s recovery lost evidentiary value. Citing V. Sejappa v. State and Ghurey Lal v. State, the Court reiterated the presumption of innocence and the high threshold for disturbing an acquittal. Concluding that the evidence did not satisfy the legal standards for conviction, the Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the acquittal.",

The prosecution charged the accused under Sections 498‑A, 304‑B and 302 IPC, alleging dowry harassment. The trial court acquitted the accused, finding the evidence insufficient. Renganathan appealed under Section 372 Cr.P.C. to set aside the acquittal.",
    "arguments": "Appellant argued that the accused demanded money, that the string recovered linked him to the murder, and that the post‑mortem confirmed homicide, invoking Sections 498‑A, 304‑B and 302 IPC. Respondent (State) contended that the demand was not dowry‑related, that the prosecution’s witnesses were limited to family members, and that there was no corroborative evidence linking the accused to the murder. The accused maintained innocence and no defence evidence was examined.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that the presumption of innocence prevails and that an order of acquittal can be disturbed only on clear, cogent evidence. It observed that the prosecution’s case relied solely on family testimony without independent corroboration, that the alleged monetary demand was unrelated to marriage, and that the recovered string lost evidentiary significance.

Renganathan (P.W.3), who is the brother of the deceased\nviz., Perarasi, has preferred this appeal under the proviso to\nSection  372  Cr.P.C.  challenging  the  judgment  and  order  of\nacquittal dated 07.11.2017 passed by the Sessions Judge, Mahila\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nCourt, Chengalpattu, acquitting the 2nd respondent in S.C.No.64\nof  2014  of  the  offences  under  Sections  498-A  and  304-B\nalternatively 302 IPC.\n3. The prosecution story runs thus :\n3.1. The 2nd respondent/accused got married to Perarasi on\n01.03.2009 and the couple was blessed with a son viz., Vishwa on\n11.03.2011.  The couple was residing in Visoor Salai, Manambathi\nVillage, Anthonypuram, Uttiramerur Taluk.\n3.2. On 07.04.2013, Renganathan (P.W.3), received a phone\ncall around 11.45 p.m. from his sister Perarasi, who told him\nthat the accused is demanding money and was threatening to\nfinish her, if she does not give him the money.  Therefore, it\nis  Renganathan's (P.W.3's) case that he went along with his\nfather Ramu (P.W.1) to the house of the accused. When he went\nthere, he found his sister lying in the verandah, with injuries\naround her neck.\n3.3. Therefore, Ramu (P.W.1) gave a complaint (Ex.P1), based\non which, the 1st respondent police registered a case in Crime\nNo.129 of 2013 on 08.04.2013 under Section 174 Cr.P.C. and\nprepared  the  printed  FIR  (Ex.P11).   It  is  seen  that  the\ncomplaint  and  the  printed  FIR  reached  the  jurisdictional\nMagistrate only on 10.04.2013 at 04.30 p.m.\n3.4. Investigation of the case was taken over by Rajendran,\nDeputy Superintendent of Police, who went to the place of\noccurrence and prepared an observation mahazar (Ex.P2) and a\nrough sketch (Ex.P12). He requested Chellappa (P.W.5), Revenue\nDivisional Officer (RDO) to conduct inquest over the body of\nPerarasi, as the death was within seven years of marriage.\n3.5. The body of Perarasi was sent to the Government\nHospital,  Chengalpattu,  for  postmortem,  where  Dr.Parasakthi\n(P.W.7) performed autopsy on the body of Perarasi and issued the\npostmortem certificate (Ex.P8), wherein, she has opined the\ncause of death as follows :\n“OPINION AS TO CAUE OF DEATH:\na) The deceased would appear to have died of\nasphyxia due to strangulation.\nb) Death would have occurred 14 to 18 hrs prior to\npostmortem.”\n3.6.  The  inquest  report  of  the  RDO  (Chellappa/P.W.5)\ndisclosed that there are prima facie materials to show that the\ndeath of Perarasi could be due to dowry harassment.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n3.7. The accused was arrested on 09.04.2013 at 10.00 a.m.\nand based on his confession statement, a 30 ft. string that was\nallegedly used for strangulating Perarasi was recovered in the\npresence of Murugan (P.W.4) and Kuppan (not examined) under the\ncover of mahazar (Ex.P4).\n3.8.  After  recording  the  statements  of  witnesses  and\ncollecting various reports, Rajendran (P.W.10) completed the\ninvestigation and filed a final report against the accused for\nthe offences under Sections 498-A, 304-B and 302 IPC before the\nDistrict  Munsif-cum-Judicial  Magistrate,  Uthiramerur  in\nP.R.C.No.6 of 2014.\n3.9. On appearance of the accused, the provisions of Section\n207 Cr.P.C. were complied with and the case was committed to the\nCourt of Session in S.C.No.64 of 2014 and was made over to the\nMahila Court, Chengalpattu, for trial.\n3.10. The trial Court framed charges under Sections 498-A,\n302 and 304-B IPC against the accused and when questioned, he\npleaded “not guilty”.  To prove the case, the prosecution\nexamined 10 witnesses, marked 14 exhibits and one material\nobject.\n3.11. When the accused was questioned under Section 313\nCr.P.C., he denied the allegations.  No witness was examined\nfrom the side of the accused.\n3.12. After considering the evidence on record and hearing\neither side, the trial Court, by a judgment and order dated\n07.11.2017 in S.C.No.64 of 2014, has acquitted the accused of\nall the charges, aggrieved by which, this appeal has been filed\nby Renganathan (P.W.3) under the proviso to Section 372 Cr.P.C.\nas stated above.\n4.

Before adverting to the rival submissions, it may be\nnecessary to bear in mind the law relating to interference\nagainst an order of acquittal which has been summarised by the\nSupreme  Court  in  V.Sejappa  Vs.  State  [(2016)12  SCC  150].\nFurther, in Ghurey Lal Vs. State of U.P. [(2008)10 SCC 450], the\nSupreme Court has held that during trial, there is a presumption\nof innocence in favour of the accused and that further gets\nstrengthened, when the accused is acquitted by the trial Court.\nTherefore, the appellate Court should be slow in interfering\nwith an order of acquittal.\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n6. In this case, both Perarasi and the accused were working\nas school teachers. Except the evidence of the close relatives\nof Perarasi viz., Ramu (P.W.1-Father), Lakshmi (P.W.2-Mother)\nand  Ranganathan  (P.W.3-Brother),  the  prosecution  had  not\nexamined any other witness to speak about the marital life of\nthe  couple.   The  trial  Court  has  placed  reliance  on  the\npostmortem findings and has concluded that the death was on\naccount of homicide.\n7. Even the evidences of Ramu (P.W.1) and Renganathan\n(P.W.3) are to the effect that when they went to the house of\nPerarasi, they found her in the verandah with injuries on her\nneck.  With regard to the motive, it is the case of Ramu\n(P.W.1),  Lakshmi  (P.W.2)  and  Renganathan  (P.W.3)  that  the\naccused demanded Rs.2,00,000/- on three occasions, for his real\nestate business. This has been disbelieved by the trial Court as\nthere was no proof to show that the accused was doing real\nestate business and the witnesses had also not stated in their\ndeposition that the accused was in need of money.\n8. To cap it all, during examination, Ramu (P.W.1) admitted\nthat six months prior to the incident, Perarasi went missing and\na sum of Rs.5,00,000/- was found missing from the house of the\naccused and at that time, the appellant and the family of\nPerarasi returned the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the accused. This\nclearly shows that Ramu (P.W.1), Lakshmi (P.W.2) and Renganathan\n(P.W.3) were not stating the truth.\n9.  To  attract  Section  304-B  IPC  and  the  consequent\npresumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872, the\ndemand  of  money  or  dowry  must  be  in  connection  with  the\nmarriage.  None of the witnesses has stated that the accused had\ndemanded the amount in connection with the marriage. They have\nonly stated that the accused was demanding money from Perarasi,\nsince  six  months  prior  to  her  death  for  his  real  estate\nbusiness.  Admittedly, the accused was a Government School\nteacher and he lost Rs.5,00,000/- six months ago, when Perarasi\nwent missing with the money, which was later returned to the\naccused by the family of Perarasi as discussed in para 8 above.\n10. As regards the recovery of the string on the alleged\nconfession of the accused, according to the evidence of Ramu\n(P.W.1), Lakshmi (P.W.2) and Renganathan (P.W.3), when they went\nto the house of Perarasi, they found a string around her neck.\nWhen that being so, the alleged recovery of the string after the\narrest of the accused, loses significance.  This aspect has been\nvividly discussed by the trial Court.\n11. Even at the earliest point of time, when the accused was\nexamined by Chellappan (P.W.5), RDO, during inquest, he stated\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nthat he had a quarrel on the night of 07.04.2013 and went to his\nsister's house with the child and only on the next day, he\nlearnt from TV news about the incident.  Of course, this cannot\nbe treated as a substantive piece of evidence, but, at the same\ntime, this Court cannot completely ignore it and reverse the\njudgment  and  order  of  acquittal.  There  is  absolutely  no\nscintilla of evidence to show that the accused had absconded\nwith his child after the incident, for this Court to draw an\nadverse inference against him.\n12. It is trite that when on the same set of evidence, if\ntwo views are possible, the view that favours the accused,\nmerits acceptance.  In our opinion, this is not a fit case to\nreverse the judgment and order of acquittal that has been passed\nby the trial Court by a well considered and detailed judgment.\nIn the result, this criminal appeal is dismissed and the\njudgment and order of acquittal dated 07.11.2017 passed by the\nSessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chengalpattu in S.C.No.64 of 2014,\nis confirmed.\n                            Sd/-\n     Assistant Registrar(CS VI)\n    //True Copy//\n     Sub Assistant Registrar\ngya\nTo\n1.

    "summary": "The plaintiff, MRF Ltd., sued Speedways Rubber Company, its director Pritpal Singh and Kisan Tyre House for infringing its registered trademark ‘PAHALWAN’ (Reg. No. 542604, Class 12) by using the marks ‘MAHA PEHALWAN’ and ‘PEHALWAN’ on tyres and related goods. The suit, filed under Order VII Rule 1 CPC and Sections 28, 29, 105 and 106 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, sought permanent injunctions, destruction of infringing material, and an account of profits. Defendants failed to appear, leading to an ex‑parte proceeding. Evidence presented by the plaintiff included the registration certificate, renewal certificate, sales invoices, a notary certificate confirming purchase of an infringing tyre, and other documentary proof of use of the contested mark. The Court compared the plaintiff’s mark with the defendants’ mark and held that the latter was deceptively similar, thereby infringing the plaintiff’s rights and constituting passing off. Consequently, prayers (a), (b) and (c) were granted, ordering a permanent injunction and destruction of infringing material. Prayer (d) for an account of profits was dismissed due to the defendants’ non‑appearance. The defendants were also ordered to pay Rs.2,00,000 as costs. The judgment underscores the strict protection afforded to registered trademarks under the TM Act and the court’s willingness to grant ex‑parte relief where defendants evade process.",
    "facts": "MRF Ltd. holds a registered trademark ‘PAHALWAN’ for tyres (Reg. No. 542604, Class 12) dated 28‑12‑1990, renewed for ten years from 28‑10‑2014. The defendants marketed tyres bearing the marks ‘MAHA PEHALWAN’ and ‘PEHALWAN’. The plaintiff alleged infringement and passing off, seeking injunctions, destruction of infringing goods, and an account of profits. Defendants did not appear despite service of summons. The plaintiff produced documentary evidence including the registration and renewal certificates, sales invoices of infringing tyres, a notary‑certified purchase receipt, and a legal user certificate. The Court recorded ex‑parte evidence and examined the plaintiff’s senior manager as witness.",
    "arguments": "The plaintiff argued that the defendants’ marks were identical or deceptively similar to its registered mark, causing likelihood of confusion and constituting passing off. It relied on the registration certificate, renewal certificate, and sales documents to prove ownership and use. The plaintiff also invoked Sections 28, 29, 105 and 106 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act for injunction and damages. The defendants made no submissions as they failed to appear.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court compared the visual and phonetic similarity of ‘MAHA PEHALWAN’/‘PEHALWAN’ with ‘PAHALWAN’ and found them deceptively similar, satisfying the test for infringement under the TM Act. The absence of any defence due to non‑appearance justified ex‑parte relief. While the plaintiff proved entitlement to injunctions and destruction of infringing material, the Court could not grant an account of profits because the defendants were unavailable to furnish accounts. Costs were awarded on the costs‑follow‑the‑event principle.",

In spite of service of suit summons, the defendants  did not \nenter appearance.  Therefore, by order dated 20.07.2021, the defen dants \nwere set ex parte  and the suit was posted for recording ex parte  evidence on \nbehalf of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff examined Mr.George Samuel, its  Senior \nManager - Sales, as P.W.1.  In course of the examination-in-chief of P.W.1, \n10 documents were exhibited as Exs.P1 to P10.  Ex.P9 is the lega l user \ncertificate under Class 12 for the mark PAHALWAN in rela tion to tyres. \nEx.P10 is the renewal certificate.  The renewal certificate indicat es that the \n4/8\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.S.No.968 of 2000\nregistration was renewed for the period of 10 years from 28.10.2014.  Ex.P9 \nalso  discloses  that the  registration  is with effect from  28.12.1990.   The \nplaintiff has exhibited the sales invoices relating to the purc hase of a tyre \nbearing  the  infringing  mark  as  Ex.P8.   Ex.P6  is  a  certificat e  dated \n04.10.2000 issued by a notary public disclosing that the tyre wa s purchased \nfrom a dealer on 04.10.2000 and that a yellow plastic sticker beari ng the \nword MAHA PAHALWAN was affixed thereon.\n2.

As \nregards the relief prayed for in prayer (d) of the said paragra ph, since the \ndefendants have not entered appearance, it is not possible to obtai n accounts \nor  direct  payment  of  additional  Court  fee  in  respect  of  the  cl aim  for \ndamages.

    "summary": "The petitioners, heirs of the deceased N. M. Kadamban Nambudripad, filed a Civil Revision Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution seeking to set aside the District Judge’s order of 07.10.1997 in I.A. No.85 of 1990, which had dismissed their claim for compensation from the Director of Survey and Settlements. The High Court, presided over by Justice J. Nisha Banu, considered the petitioners’ reliance on a Supreme Court judgment (Director of Survey and Settlements v. N.M. Kadamban Nambudripad (Dead) & LRs, Civil Appeals Nos. 11440‑11441, 07.08.2019) which dealt with similar compensation issues. The Court held that the Supreme Court’s decision covered the present dispute and consequently set aside the impugned District Court order. It ordered the matter to be remitted to the District Court for a fresh hearing, allowing all private parties and the State to be heard, and directed disposal within three months.

Kadamban Nambudripad (Dead) & LRs, 2019) asserting that the same legal principles applied.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision clarified the entitlement to compensation and that the District Court’s order was contrary to that precedent. They contended that the High Court should set aside the order and remand the matter for fresh consideration. The respondent (Director of Survey and Settlements) relied on the earlier District Court order and the amounts already paid, asserting that no further compensation was due.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The High Court observed that the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2019 Civil Appeals directly addressed the issues raised in the present case. Accordingly, the District Court’s order was inconsistent with the higher court’s interpretation of compensation rights.

No.324 of 1998\nFor Respondent                 :  Dr.S.Supriya\n Additional  Government  Pleader\n \nO R D E R\nThis Civil Revision Petition has been filed to set aside the order dated\npassed by the learned District Judge, Ootacamund, Nilgiris in I.A.No.85 of \n1990 dated 07.10.1997.\n2. When the matter was taken up for hearing, the learned counsel \nappearing for the petitioner produced the Judgment of the Hon'b le Supreme \nCourt  in  the  case  of  Director  of  Survey  and  Settlements  vs.  \nN.M.Kadamban nambudripad (Dead) Thr LRS and Anr. in Civil Appeal \nNos. 11440-11441 of 2014 dated 07.08.2019 and submitte d that the issue \non hand is covered by the said Hon'ble Apex Court decisio n.  The Hon'ble \nSupreme Court held as follows:\nSuffice  it  to  observe  that  the  High  Court  while \nentertaining  C.R.P.  No.  324  of  1998,  whereby  the  orde r  \npassed  by  the  District Court  Niligris,  Udagamandalam  in \nI.A.  No.  85  of  1990  dated  07.10.1997  was  assailed  ha d  \npassed interim directions to the appellant State whi ch orders  \nare assailed in these appeals.\nPage No:2/7 \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P. No.324 of 1998\nThe operative  order  passed  by the District Court on 07.10.1997,  \nreads thus:\n“.........9. It has been represented on the  \nside of the petitioners that out of the sum of  \nRs. 22,86,874/- deposited in this court, a sum \nof  Rs.  22,13,577.80  has  been  paid  towards  \ncompensation for the various Janmams by the \nDirector of Survey and Settlement. At present  \nonly a sum of Rs. 73,396.70 is available in the  \nCourt.  Both  sides  were  not  able  to  tell  the  \nperson to whom the amount is due. A sum of  \nRs.  34,346.40  only  is  due  for  Nelliyalam  \nJanmam Estate as per the order of Director of  \nSurvey  and  Settlement.  It  is  clear  that  the  \namount fixed in the R. Ex. No.1 is to be paid  \nto  the  petitioners.  Only  lesser  amount  will \nreach the petitioners. Because due to fixation  \nof  compensation  to  the  petitioners  as  Rs. \n34,346/- no higher amount will be eligible to  \nthe  petitioners.   The  amount  as  per  R.  Ex.  \nNo.1 is Rs. 34,346/-. No higher amount will be  \neligible  to  the  petitioners.  The  petitioners  \nhave already received Rs. 62,580.80 paise in  \nPage No:3/7 \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P. No.324 of 1998\nI.A. No. 86/90,  87/90.  Therefore,  I conclude  \nthat the amount required by the petitioners is  \nnot  due  to  the  petitioners.  This  summary  is \ndecided against the petitioners.\n10. Finally, the petition is dismissed. No costs  \nin the interest of justice.”\n When the matter was taken up before the High \nCourt by way of C.R.P. No. 324 of 1998 by the  \nrespondents  herein,  the  High  Court  passed  \ninterim directions against the State from time to  \ntime.  All  those  orders  are  subject  matter  of \nchallenge in the present appeals.\nDuring the pendency of these appeals, the other  \nsix  janmams  who  claim  to  be  entitled  for  \ncompensation  amount  alongwith  the \nrespondents  herein,  as  per  the  scheme  \npropounded  have  also approached  this Court  \nby way of impleadment application. We propose  \nto  allow  the  said  application  and  to  do  \nsubstantial justice to the parties set aside  the  \nimpugned  orders  passed  by  the  High  Court  \nincluding  the  order  passed  by  the  District \nPage No:4/7 \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P. No.324 of 1998\nCourt  dated  07.10.1997  and  instead  relegate  \nthe eight janmams before the District Court for  \nreconsideration  of  I.A.  No.  85  of  1990  in \naccordance with law after giving opportunity to \nall of them, namely, all the private parties and  \nthe State authorities. We order accordingly.\nThe appeals are allowed in the aforementioned  \nterms.\n The District Court shall  now decide  the  I.A. \nNo.  85  of  1990  afresh  as  per  law  and  \nuninfluenced  by  any  observation(s)  made  by \nthe High Court in the impugned order(s) or the  \nDistrict  Court;  which have  been  set  aside  in  \nterms of this order. \nThe  parties  to  appear  before  the  concerned  \nDistrict  Court  on  03.09.2019.  The  District \nCourt  may  proceed  with  the  hearing  of  the  \nrestored I.A. No. 85 of 1990 on the same day or  \nany  other  suitable  day  but  ensure  that  it  is \ndisposed  of  preferably  within  three  months  \ntherefrom. All questions available to the parties  \nare left open.\nPage No:5/7 \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P. No.324 of 1998\nPending  applications,  if  any,  stand  disposed  \nof.”\n3. In view of the orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court,  in Civil \nAppeal No.11440 to 11441 of 2014 dated 07.08.2019,  no further orders \nneed to be passed in this Civil Revision Petition.

No.24 of 2021) filed on 12 February 2021, petitioners Thiyagarajan and Subha approached the Madras High Court seeking anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code. They feared arrest by the Coimbatore City Crime Branch police in connection with a crime (number not known) allegedly involving offences punishable under IPC Sections 294(b), 406, 420 and 506(ii). The petition was heard via video conferencing before Justice V. Bharathidasan. During the hearing, the Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that no FIR, charge sheet, or enquiry was pending against the petitioners. Relying on this submission, the Court found no substantive basis to entertain the anticipatory bail application and consequently ordered the petition to be closed. The order, dated 12 February 2021, directed that it be observed and executed by all concerned parties. No substantive arguments from the petitioners or precedents were cited. The decision underscores the principle that anticipatory bail cannot be granted in the absence of a pending criminal proceeding or credible threat of arrest.",

    "summary": "The petition (W.P. No.69 of 2022) was filed by M. Paramasivam under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of mandamus to restrain the Tamil Nadu Water & Drainage Board from digging or constructing a combined water‑supply scheme booster station on Survey No. 269/6, Avatti Village, which allegedly blocks the petitioner’s only access route to his 2.65‑acre agricultural land inherited from his mother. The petitioner contended that the land had been handed over to the District Health and Family Welfare Department, but the local panchayat, allegedly under political influence, transferred it to the Board without proper handover, leading to construction that impedes ingress and egress. The respondents argued that 45% of the work was completed and that a 200‑foot‑wide, 150‑foot‑long road had been allocated to protect the petitioner’s access, thereby addressing his grievance. The Court examined the submissions and a communication dated 04‑01‑2022 showing the road’s allocation for public use.

That survey was later handed to the District Health and Family Welfare Department, but the local panchayat transferred it to the Tamil Nadu Water & Drainage Board, which began constructing a booster station. The construction blocked the petitioner’s sole access route, prompting the writ petition.",

    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court noted the communication dated 04‑01‑2022 confirming the allocation of a public road of sufficient width and length to ensure access to the petitioner’s land.

The case of the petitioner is that his mother owned patta\nland situated in various survey numbers, Avatti Village and\nPost, Tittagudi Taluk, Cuddalore District to the extent of 2.65\nacres  and  after  his  mother's  death,  the  petitioner  is\ncultivating the agricultural crops in the said land and he is\nhaving to reach his land through the land in S.F.No.269/6 and\nhowever subsequently, the land in the said survey number was\nhanded  over  to  the  District  Health  and  Family  Welfare\nDepartment. But the local panchayat office without handing over\nthe  said  land  to  the  District  Health  and  Family  Welfare\nDepartment, have taken steps to hand over the same to the Tamil\nNadu Water and Drainage Board and the said Board in turn\ninspected the spot and made attempt to dig and construct the\nCombined  Water  Supply  Scheme  Booster  Station.  It  is  the\ngrievance of the petitioner that since the said Booster Station\nwas  under  construction,  the  entire  access  to  reach  the\npetitioner's land is prevented. Aggrieved by the same, the\npresent petition is filed.\n3.  The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  petitioner\nsubmitted that the local politicians influenced the panchayat to\nconstruct the said Booster Station, due to which, the entire\ncultivation will be spoiled, since the petitioner cannot enter\nto his lands except through the land in said S.F.No.269/6 and\nhence prays for appropriate orders of this Court.\n4. The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for\nthe respondents submitted that already 45% of the work has been\ncompleted for construction of  the Combined Water Supply Scheme\nBooster Station and further in order to protect the ingress and\negress of the petitioner' land, a road having 200 feet width and\n150 feet length was allocated and hence the grievance sought for\nby the petitioner in the present petition has been answered and\nprays for dismissal of this petition.\n5. This Court has carefully considered the rival submissions\nand also perused the materials placed on record.\n6. It is seen from the communication dated 04.01.2022,\nproduced before this Court that the road having 200 feet width\nand 150 feet length has been allocated as pathway for the\ngeneral  public  use  and  hence  nothing  survives  for  further\nadjudication as the relief sought for by the petitioner has been\nanswered.

No.137 of 2000) before the Madras High Court challenges two lower‑court decisions concerning a suit for specific performance of a 1985 sale agreement between the deceased plaintiff R. Premchand and the heirs of Govindaraja Naicker. The District Munsif dismissed the suit, deeming the agreement fabricated, while the Principal Sub Judge set aside that dismissal, holding the insertion in the margin immaterial and allowing the appeal. The second appeal raises three substantial questions of law: (1) whether the lower courts erred in finding the agreement proved despite doubts about the signature; (2) whether the plaintiff sufficiently proved the signature given discrepancies between exhibits; and (3) whether the courts erred in not examining the plaintiff’s readiness and willingness to pay the balance consideration. The Court, aided by amicus curiae, notes that the plaintiff’s deposit challan (Ex A‑11) demonstrates readiness, a point not contested by defendants. Regarding the first two questions, the Court observes conflicting findings on the document’s authenticity and stresses that the signature of Govindaraja Naicker was disputed and the agreement was executed after his death. Consequently, the Court holds that the lower courts erred in accepting the agreement as genuine and partially sets aside the earlier judgment, allowing the appeal in part while upholding the dismissal of the specific‑performance claim.",
    "facts": "R. Premchand filed a suit in 1996 seeking specific performance of a sale agreement dated 30‑09‑1985 with Govindaraja Naicker for land in Puducheri Village. Govindaraja Naicker died on 28‑11‑1985. The plaintiff paid an advance and claimed the second defendant (a son of Naicker) accepted further advance on 04‑12‑1985. Defendants denied the existence and validity of the agreement, disputing the signature. The District Munsif found the agreement fabricated and dismissed the suit. The Principal Sub Judge reversed that finding, holding the marginal insertion immaterial. The present second appeal questions the authenticity of the agreement and the plaintiff’s readiness to perform.",
    "arguments": "For the appellants (defendants‑appellants), counsel argued that the agreement was forged, the signature of Govindaraja Naicker was absent or falsified, and the plaintiff had not proved the document’s authenticity. They also contended that the plaintiff’s readiness to pay was not established. For the respondents (plaintiff’s heirs), counsel relied on the sale agreement, the endorsement dated 04‑12‑1985, and the deposit challan (Ex A‑11) as evidence of readiness and willingness to perform.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the documentary evidence, noting the marginal insertion and differences between Ex A‑1 and Ex A‑2, and the lack of a verified signature of Govindaraja Naicker. It held that the lower courts erred in treating the agreement as proved without such verification. However, the Court found that the plaintiff’s deposit challan demonstrated readiness and willingness, a point not contested by defendants, and therefore no procedural irregularity existed in not examining that issue. The Court thus partially allowed the appeal, setting aside the finding of a valid agreement while upholding the dismissal of the specific‑performance claim.",

No. 81 of 1996 on the file \nof the District Munsif Court, Chenglapet (originally O.S. No. 47 of 1987 \non the file of Sub Court, Chengalpet) are the appellant s.\n2.  The suit in O.S. No. 47 of 1987, subsequently on transfer  to the \nDistrict Munsif Court, renumbered as O.S. No. 81 of 19 96 had been filed \nR. Premchand, the 1st respondent who died pending the second appeal, \nseeking specific performance of an agreement dated 30.09 .1985, alleged to \nhave been entered into with him by Govindaraja Naicke r with respect to \nthe suit schedule punja lands at Puducheri Village ham let of Kattur Village, \nGuduvanchery, Chengalpet. The defendants in the suit w ere the legal heirs \nof Govindaraja Naicker.  The 2nd defendant remained exparte. During the \npendency of the suit, the 3rd defendant died and his legal representatives \nhad been brought on record as 8th to 11th defendants.\n3.  By judgment dated 11.07.1997, the District Munsif, Chengalpe t \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n4\ndismissed the suit with costs.\n4.  The plaintiff then filed A.S. No. 66 of 1997 before  the Principal \nSub Court, Chengalpet. By judgment dated 31.03.1999, the ap peal suit \nwas allowed with costs and the decree of the trial cou rt in O. S. No. 81 of \n1996 was set aside.\n5.  This had necessitated the 1st, 4th, 6th to 11th defendants to file the \npresent  second  appeal.  Pending  the  appeal,  the  3rd respondent/5th \ndefendant  in  the  suit  and  the  1st respondent/plaintiff  in  the  suit/R. \nPremchand died and their legal representatives had been b rought on record \nas 4th to 7th and 8th to 12th respondents respectively.\n6.   The  second  appeal  had  been  admitted  on  the  following  \nsubstantial questions of law :\n“1. Whether the lower Court erred in \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n5\ncoming to the conclusion that Ex. A-1, the \nsale agreement, dated 30.09.1985, has been \nproved in spite of the fact that P .W.2 admits  \nthat he is not aware whether Ex. A-1 contains  \nthe  signature  of  Govindaraja  Naicker  or \nnot ? \n2. Is  the  lower  Court  right  in \nconcluding that the plaintiff has proved Ex. \nA-1 especially when no attempts have been \nmade  by  him  to  prove  the  signature  of \nGovindaraja Naicker with that of any of his \nadmitted signatures, especially when there is \nocean of difference between Exs. A-1 and A-\n2?\n3. Has  the  lower  Court  committed \ngrave  error  in  not  at  all  going  into  the \nquestion as to the willingness and readiness \nof the plaintiff from the date of agreement till \nfiling of suit, more so when the fact is not \nadmitted by the defendants ? “\n7.  As stated, the 1st respondent/plaintiff in the suit died pending the \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n6\nsecond appeal and his legal representatives had been brought on record as \n8th to 12 respondents. Though notice had been served, t hey had taken a \nconscious  decision  not  to  appear  before  this  Court.  Thi s  Court  had \ntherefore appointed Mr. K. Venkatasubban, Advocate to assist the Court as \namicus to put forth their case.\nO.S. No. 81 of 1996 (District Munsif Court, Chengelpet) (Originally  \nO.S. No. 47 of 1987 on the file of Sub Court, Chengelpet) :\n8.  The  plaintiff, R. Premchand sought specific perform ance of an \nagreement  which  he  claimed  had  been  entered  into  by  him  with \nGovindaraja Naicker on 30.09.1985 with respect to the suit sche dule punja \nlands  at  Puducheri  Village  hamlet  of  Kattur  Village,  G uduvanchery, \nChengalpet  for  total  consideration  of  Rs.  16,640/-.  An  adv ance  of \nRs.2,101/- was stated to have been paid as advance. Govin daraja Naicker \ndied on 28.11.1985. It was further claimed that the 2nd defendant, one of \nthe  sons  of  Govindaraja  Naicker,  who  remained  exparte  i n  the  suit, \napproached the plaintiff on 04.12.1985 and received further a dvance of \nRs.1,300/-. Claiming that he was ready and willing to pa y the balance sale \nconsideration and further complaining that though no tice had been issued \ncalling upon the legal representatives to execute sale deed in accordance of \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n7\nthe agreement, they had not so come forward, the suit h ad been instituted \nseeking specific performance of the said agreement.\n9.   The  defendants/legal  representatives  of Govindaraja  Naicker \ndenied and disputed the claims of the plaintiff. The y denied the assertion \nthat Govindaraja Naicker had entered into an agreemen t with the plaintiff. \nThey disputed his signature. They claimed that the agreement was not \nbinding on them. They urged that the suit should be  dismissed.\n10.  On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues w ere framed \nfor trial :\n“1.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled for \nspecific performance ?\n2.  Whether the sale agreement dated \n30.09.1985 is true and valid binding on the \ndefendants ? \n3. To what relief ?”\n11.  Issue relating to readiness and willingness on the pa rt of the \nplaintiff to pay the balance sale consideration was not framed.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n8\n12.  The parties were invited to graze the witness box.\n13.   The plaintiff, R. Premchand examined himself as P. W.1 and \nexamined two other witnesses as P.W. 2 and P.W. 3. They mar ked Exs. A1 \nto A14. Ex. A1 was the agreement of sale dated 30.09.1985 and Ex. A2 \nwas the endorsement dated 04.12.1985. Ex. A3 was the notice iss ued by \nthe  plaintiff.  Ex.  A11  was  the  challan  for  deposit  of  bal ance  sale \nconsideration.\n14.  The 5th defendant, Punniyakoti examined himself as D.W.1 and \nhe  examined  a  further  witness  as  D.W.2.  They  marked  Ex.  B 1,  a \ndischarged mortgage deed dated 07.06.1944.\n15.   On  consideration  of  the  pleadings,  oral  and  documentary  \nevidence,  the  District  Munsif,  Chengelpet  held  that  Ex .  A1  was  a \nfabricated document. She observed that it had been execu ted at Tambaram, \nwhere neither the plaintiff nor Govindaraja Naicker resided. She further \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n9\nobserved that the document written very closely in page 1 and with more \nspace in page 2. She further stated that there was an i nsertion on the left \nside margin with a pen of different ink. She opined t hat the document had \nbeen written after obtaining signatures of Govindaraj a Naicker in blank \npapers.  She  observed  that  the  last  word  in page  1  had  bee n  written \nadjusting the spacing to accommodate the signature. Sh e pointed out the \ncontradictions in the evidences of P.W.2 and P.W.3 on m aterial aspects of \nsigning the document by Govindaraja Naicker. She final ly held that the \ndocument,  Ex. A1,  the agreement of sale  had been fabric ated  for the \npurpose of the case. \n16.   The  suit  was  dismissed  with  costs  by  judgment  dated \n11.07.1997.\nA.S. No. 66 of 1987 (Principal Sub Court, Chengelpet) :\n17.  The plaintiff filed the above appeal suit. By judgment  dated \n31.03.1999, the Principal Sub Judge re-examined the evidence  on record. \nHe framed points for consideration, particularly with re spect to the validity \nof Ex. A.1. Again no point was framed with respect to r eadiness and \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n10\nwillingness of the plaintiff to perform his part of the a greement.\n18.  The Principal Sub Judge differed from the reasoning given by \nthe District Munsif.  He opined that though there was  an insertion in the \nleft margin, it would not materially affect the val idity of the agreement. \nAccording to him, it related to a minor issue of advance sale consideration. \nHe  brushed  aside  all  findings  of  the  District  Munsif  relating  to  the \nagreement as being inconsequential, and allowed the ap peal suit and set \naside the judgment of the trial Court.\nS.A. No. 137 of 2000 :\n19.  The defendants then filed the present second appeal.\n20.   The  second  appeal  had  been  admitted  on  the  following \nsubstantial questions of law : \n“ 1. Whether the lower Court erred in \ncoming to the conclusion that Ex. A-1, the \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n11\nsale  agreement,  dated  30.09.1985,  has \nbeen proved in spite of the fact that P .W.2 \nadmits that he is not aware whether Ex. A-\n1  contains  the  signature  of  Govindaraja \nNaicker or not ?\n2. Is  the  lower  Court  right  in \nconcluding  that  the  plaintiff  has  proved \nEx. A-1 especially when no attempts have \nbeen made by him to prove the signature of \nGovindaraja Naicker with that of any of \nhis  admitted  signatures,  especially  when \nthere is ocean of difference between Exs. \nA-1 and A-2 ?\n3. Has the lower Court committed \ngrave error  in not at all going into the \nquestion  as  to  the  willingness  and \nreadiness of the plaintiff from the date of \nagreement till filing of suit, more so when \nthe fact is not admitted by the defendants ? \n“\n21.  Heard arguments advanced by Mr. K. Chandrasekaran, learn ed \ncounsel for the appellants and Mr. K. Venkatasubban, lear ned Amicus \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n12\nCuriae appointed to assist the Court owing to non-appear ance by the 8th to \n12th respondents/legal heirs of the plaintiff.\n22.  Let me address the parties as plaintiff and defendants.  The \ndefendants are the appellants in the second appeal. The plai ntiff was the 1st \nrespondent. During the pendency of the second appeal he d ied and his \nlegal representatives have been impleaded as the 8th to 12th respondents.\nLet me address the 3rd substantial question of law first. This revolves \naround ess ‘ readin and willingness’  of the plaintiff to perform his part of \nthe agreement. It is seen that both the Courts below had n ot addressed this \nissue. However, Ex. A 11 had been produced by the plainti ff which is the \nchallan for deposit of the balance sale consideration  into Court. Naturally, \nthis would indicate ‘ readiness  and willingness’  unless disputed, which \ndispute had not been raised by the defendants. I wou ld therefore answer \nthe 3rd substantial question of law that  there  is  no irregul arity in the \nprocedure of the Courts below, on the facts of this c ase, in not examining \nthe issue of ‘readiness and willingness’.\n23.  The 1st and 2nd substantial questions of law however require \ndeep consideration. Differing opinions have been give n by the District \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n13\nMunsif and by the Principal Sub Judge regarding Ex. A1, the agreement of \nsale.  It must be kept in mind that the suit had bee n instituted well after the \ndeath  of  Govindaraja  Naicker,  the  executant  of  the  agr eement.  His \nsignature had been denied and disputed by the defendants.\n24.  The District Munsif had given cogent reason",

    "summary": "The petitioners, V. Srimathi and S.D. Shankar, filed W.P. No.42 of 2022 under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of certiorari to quash an order dated 28‑12‑2021 passed by the Revenue Tahsildar, Modakkurichi, which was issued pursuant to a 23‑04‑2018 order of the District Collector, Erode under Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. The petitioners had earlier filed W.P. No.26264 of 2021 challenging a sale notice issued by the first respondent and, by order dated 09‑12‑2021, withdrew that petition with liberty to appeal before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under Section 17 of the same Act. No evidence was placed that such an appeal had been filed. The petitioners argued that the writ petition should be entertained despite the pending appeal, while the respondents contended that simultaneous proceedings are impermissible and that the writ petition is premature because the primary order of the District Collector remains unchallenged. The Court held that the writ petition is not maintainable as the appropriate remedy lies in the pending DRT appeal and the order under Section 14 has not been directly contested. Consequently, the petition was dismissed and the related writ numbers closed.",
    "facts": "The petitioners sought to quash a Tahsildar's order dated 28‑12‑2021, which was a consequential order to a District Collector's order dated 23‑04‑2018 under Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Earlier, they had filed a writ petition (W.P. No.26264 of 2021) against a sale notice, withdrew it on 09‑12‑2021, and were directed to appeal before the Debt Recovery Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act. No record of such an appeal was produced. The present writ petition was filed again to challenge the Tahsildar's order without having first appealed against the Collector's order.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners argued that the Tahsildar's order adversely affected them and should be set aside, contending that the pending DRT appeal does not bar the writ. Respondents argued that the writ is premature, that the proper remedy is the DRT appeal, and that simultaneous proceedings are not permissible. They emphasized that the order under Section 14 of the Act has not been directly challenged and that the petitioners should seek interim relief within the DRT proceedings.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the procedural history and noted that the petitioners had been granted liberty to approach the DRT under Section 17. Since no appeal was shown to have been filed, the Court inferred that the petitioners had not exhausted the statutory remedy. Moreover, the order under Section 14 of the Act, which is the parent order, remained unchallenged. The Court held that allowing the writ alongside a pending DRT appeal would result in conflicting orders and that the writ petition was therefore not maintainable. Accordingly, the petition was dismissed.",

The facts on record show that the first petitioner had\nearlier also preferred a writ petition being W.P.No.26264 of\n2021  to  challenge  the  sale  notice  issued  by  the  first\nrespondent.  By the order dated 09.12.2021, the said writ\npetition was withdrawn with liberty to maintain an appeal before\nthe Debts Recovery Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act of 2002.\n3. The pleadings of the writ petition do not show that an\nappeal was filed before the Debts Recovery Tribunal.  The\npresent writ petition has again been filed to challenge the\norder  dated  28.12.2021  passed  by  the  Revenue  Tahsildar,\nModakkurichi pursuant to the order dated 23.04.2018 passed by\nthe District Collector, Erode under Section 14 of the Act of\n2002.  The appeal lies against the order passed by the District\nCollector.\n4.  At  this  stage,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the\npetitioners submitted that the appeal was filed before the Debts\nRecovery Tribunal yesterday.  If the appeal has already been\nfiled, then simultaneous proceedings of writ cannot be allowed.\nRather, if the petitioner is aggrieved by the order impugned\nherein, he should have filed an application for grant of interim\norder before the Debts Recovery Tribunal in the appeal now\npreferred.   The  present  writ  petition  is  otherwise  not\nmaintainable because the order passed under Section 14 of the\nAct of 2002 by the District Collector, Erode has not even been\nchallenged.   The  order  now  challenged  is  nothing  but  a\nconsequential  order  to  the  order  passed  by  the  District\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nCollector, Erode dated 23.04.2018.\n5.

Dellner India (P) Limited seeks appointment of a sole arbitrator to resolve a dispute arising from Purchase Order No.07/17/0221/1131/F dated 11 January 2018 with Integral Coach Factory. The parties are bound by Conditions of Contract No. 2900, which require the respondent (Railways) to appoint an arbitrator within 60 days of notice and to submit a panel within another 60 days. Despite a notice dated 28 September 2020, the respondent failed to comply, and only after a year issued a meeting notice, rendering the process futile. The petition was heard via video conference before Justice N. Sathish Kumar. The court observed the respondent’s non‑compliance and, noting the parties’ agreement to appoint an independent sole arbitrator, exercised its power under Section 11(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Justice Authinathan, a former High Court judge, was appointed as the sole arbitrator. The order directs the arbitrator to issue notice, conduct hearings, and render an award within six months, with fees to be borne equally by the parties. Both parties bear their own costs. The order was approved on 7 September 2021.",
    "facts": "Dellner India entered into a purchase order with Integral Coach Factory on 11 January 2018, incorporating Conditions of Contract No. 2900 which mandated arbitration for disputes. The contract required the respondent to appoint an arbitrator within 60 days of a notice and to submit a panel within a further 60 days. A notice was served on 28 September 2020, but the respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator or submit a panel within the stipulated period. After a year, the respondent issued a meeting notice, which the petitioner considered a futile exercise. Consequently, the petitioner filed an original petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking the court’s intervention to appoint a sole arbitrator.",
    "arguments": "The petitioner argued that the respondent’s failure to appoint an arbitrator within the contractual timeline violated the arbitration clause, rendering the dispute resolution mechanism ineffective. The petitioner contended that the delay and the subsequent meeting notice were futile and that the court should intervene under Section 11(5) to appoint a sole arbitrator to avoid further prejudice. The respondent, through counsel, did not contest the appointment but highlighted procedural delays, implicitly acknowledging its non‑compliance.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The court noted the explicit contractual provision requiring timely appointment of an arbitrator and the respondent’s failure to comply despite a notice. It held that the prolonged delay defeated the purpose of the arbitration clause and that the meeting notice after a year was futile. Under Section 11(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the court has the authority to appoint a sole arbitrator when parties cannot agree or when the appointment process fails. Given the parties’ agreement to an independent arbitrator and the respondent’s breach, the court exercised its power to appoint Justice Authinathan as the sole arbitrator, directing prompt conduct of the arbitration.",

Heard the learned  counsel  appearing  for the petitioner and the \nrespondent through video conferencing. \n3. Admittedly, the parties are governed by the Conditions of Cont ract \nNo.2900  entered  in  the  purchase  order.  So,  the  Conditions  of  Co ntract \nprovides for reference to the arbitration. However, Conditions  of Contract \nstipulates that such Arbitrator is to be appointed within 60  days and the \npanel should be submitted by the respondent Railways within 60 da ys from \nthe date of demand made by the other side. However, in this c ase, despite \nthe notice was given on 28.09.2020, no such panel was submitted by th e \nrespondent Railways. Instead of submitting the panel as requi red in General \nConditions of Contract, after one year, the respondent Railways  issued a \nnotice for meeting. Therefore, this Court is of the view tha t such meeting, \nafter the period of one year is only a futile exercise. In fact, the respondent \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n7\nRailways has not appointed the Arbitrator as per the conditions  of contract \nwithin a time. \n4. In view of the above, as both sides agreed to appoint indepe ndent \nSole Arbitrator, and having regard to the purchase order dated  11.01.2018 \nwith Conditions of Contract No.2900 entered into between the par ties, it is \nordered as follows :\ni)  Honourable  Mr.  Justice  AUTHINATHAN,  Former \nJudge, Madras High Court,  residing at Flat No. 37, A-Block, \nLakshmi Nivas,  (Opp.  To  Rajarathinam Stadium), Rukmani \nLakshmipathy  Salai,  Egmore,  Chennai-600  008,  Contact \nNos.94455  08822  /  94430  84123,  Email  ID  :- \njusticeauthinathan@gmail.com   is appointed as the Arbitrator \nto enter upon reference and adjudicate the disputes inter se  the \nparties.\nii] That the learned Arbitrator appointed  herein, shall \nafter issuing notice to the parties and upon hearing them, pas s \nan  award  as  expeditiously  as  possible,  preferably  withi n  a \nperiod of six months from the date of receipt of the Order.  \niii] That  the  learned  Sole  Arbitrator  appointed  herein \nshall be paid fees and other incidental charges, fixed by him  \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n8\nand the same shall be borne by the parties equally.  \n5.

    "summary": "The petition is a civil revision under Section 115 CPC filed by Thirumalaisamy (petitioners) seeking to set aside the final order of the District Munsif Court, Udumalpet, dated 23‑11‑2018, which dismissed his application for condonation of delay in restoring a suit (O.S. No.407 of 2004). The original suit was dismissed for default because the plaintiff was absent on 11‑11‑2008. He later filed a restoration application (I.A. No.759 of 2009) which was allowed on condition of paying Rs.300, a cost he failed to pay, leading to dismissal on 07‑07‑2010. He then filed another application (I.A. No.2011 of 2013) invoking Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone a 1,114‑day delay. The trial judge rejected the application, finding no specific reason for the delay and noting that the plaintiff had not produced medical evidence of illness. The respondents objected, emphasizing the plaintiff’s knowledge of the suit’s dismissal and his participation in a police enquiry in February 2013, which indicated awareness of the case’s status. The High Court affirmed the trial judge’s decision, dismissing the revision petition on merits and closing the connected miscellaneous petition. No costs were awarded.",
    "facts": "The plaintiff filed a suit (O.S. No.407 of 2004) which was dismissed for default due to his non‑appearance on 11‑11‑2008. He later sought restoration (I.A. No.759 of 2009) and was conditionally allowed upon payment of Rs.300, which he did not pay, resulting in dismissal on 07‑07‑2010. He subsequently filed an application (I.A. No.2011 of 2013) under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone a delay of 1,114 days. The plaintiff claimed illness (jaundice) treated in Kerala as the reason for delay. The respondents contested, stating the plaintiff was aware of the suit’s dismissal and had attended a police enquiry in February 2013, indicating no genuine impediment.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that the plaintiff’s illness prevented timely payment of costs and filing of the restoration application, and therefore the delay should be condoned under Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Respondents’ counsel contended that the plaintiff failed to provide any specific medical proof, that he was aware of the suit’s dismissal, and that his participation in a police enquiry demonstrated his capacity to act, rendering the delay indefensible.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The trial judge correctly observed that the plaintiff offered no documentary proof of illness and that his conduct—attending a police enquiry and being aware of the suit’s dismissal—negated any claim of inability to act. Consequently, the requirements of Section 5 Limitation Act were not satisfied. The High Court affirmed this reasoning, finding no ground for interference and dismissing the revision petition on merits.",

The revision petitioner herein is the plaintiff in  the suit in \nO.S.No.407 of 2014 on the file of the District Munsif Court, U dumalpet, \nwhich  has  been  filed  for  the  relief  of  permanent  injuncti on  and  other \nconsequential relief against the respondents/defendants.  The said suit was \ndismissed for default due to his absence on 11.11.2008.  The reafter, he filed a \nrestoration application in I.A.No.759 of 2009, which was allowed on payment \nof cost of Rs.300/- by order dated 22.06.2010.   Since the pl aintiff has not \npaid the said cost, the petition was dismissed on 07.07.201 0.  Subsequently, \nhe  filed  an  application  in  I.A.No.2011  of  2013  under  Sect ion  5  of  the \nLimitation Act  to condone the delay of 1114 days.  The said  application was \nstrongly objected by the defendants.  On hearing both side,  the trial Judge \ndismissed the said application.  Aggrieved by that, the plaintiff has filed this \nrevision.\n3.  At the time of the arguments, the learned counsel ap pearing \nfor the revision petitioner submits that since the plaintiff w as taking treatment \nin Kerala for Jaundice, he was not able to pay the cost.  H ence, he prays to \ncondone the delay. It is his further contention that if a n opportunity is given, \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P(NPD).No.39 of  2019\nthe plaintiff will establish his case before the trial  Court.  But the learned \ncounsel for the respondents/defendants strongly objected the  application by \npointing out that the reason for the delay was not specifi cally stated by the \nplaintiff which is a main ingredient to invoke  Section 5 of t he Limitation Act.\n4.  The trial Judge rightly appreciated the fact that the  petitioner \nhas not produced any proof for his illness.  Furthermore, thou gh as per the \ncontention of the revision petitioner, he was unwell upt o March 2013 but \nduring  the  month  of  February  2013,  he  attended  the  enquiry  which  was \nconducted  by  the  Land  Grabbing  Police  at  Tiruppur  along  wi th  his \ndefendants.  During that enquiry, the defendants establish ed their title based \nupon a sale deed relating to the suit property and also informed the a uthorities \nthat the suit was dismissed for default, thereby he conte nded that the plaintiff \nwas very well aware about the purchase made by the def endants as well the \nsuit which was dismissed for default.\n5.   Those  facts  clearly  reveal  that  the  plaintiff  is  ha ving \nknowledge about the dismissal of the suit but he has not t aken any steps \nimmediately  to  restore  the  same   for  the  reasons  best  known  to  him. \nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nC.R.P(NPD).No.39 of  2019\nMoreover, based upon the purchase, the defendants contended  that they are in \npossession of the property.  On the other hand, the plaintiff contended that he \nis in enjoyment of the property. To prove his right and t itle, the plaintiff has to \napproach the right forum.  But in this case, he failed to  disclose the sufficient \nreason for condoning the delay, which was rightly apprecia ted by the trial \nCourt which calls for no interference by this Court.\n6.   Hence, the  order passed  by the  trial  Judge  is  confir med. \nAccordingly,  this  Civil  Revision  Petition  is  dismissed  o n  merits. \nConsequently connected Miscellaneous Petition is Closed.

    "summary": "The petitioners, heirs of Subbakkal (the mother of the original owners), challenged the government notification acquiring their property in Ganapathy Village, Coimbatore, under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and the subsequent declaration under Section 6. They argued that the land belonged to Subbakkal’s heirs, that the father had no authority to consent, that proper notice and hearing were not given, and that compensation was never deposited. The State appealed, but the Supreme Court remanded the matter for fresh consideration. The Division Bench examined the will, the lack of consent by the rightful owners, the procedural defects in the acquisition process, and the failure to deposit compensation. It held that the acquisition was illegal, quashed the notification and the award, and ordered the matter to be restored to the petitioners. The decision underscores the necessity of strict compliance with procedural safeguards in land acquisition, especially where occupied houses and livelihood‑dependent tenants are involved.",
    "facts": "The property in Survey No.142/1, Ganapathy Village, Coimbatore, was originally owned by Subbakkal, who executed a will granting life estate to herself and her husband Kaliappa Gounder and thereafter vesting the remainder in her daughters (the petitioners). After Kaliappa’s death, the heirs sought to protect the land from acquisition. The Government issued a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (G.O. Ms.No.1119, 15‑05‑1985) and a declaration under Section 6 (G.O. Ms.No.1536, 18‑06‑1986). The acquisition proceeded despite objections, and no compensation was deposited. The petitioners filed a writ petition under Article 226 to quash the notification and award.",
    "arguments": "Petitioners contended that (i) the land belonged to the legal heirs under a valid will, (ii) the father/husband had no authority to consent, (iii) the statutory 60‑day notice and hearing were not complied with, (iv) the acquisition officer’s recommendation ignored the objections, (v) compensation was never deposited as required by the Act, and (vi) the presence of occupied houses and tenants meant the land could not be acquired for public purpose. The State argued that the acquisition was lawfully effected under the powers conferred by the Act.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Bench held that the acquisition was vitiated by procedural irregularities: lack of proper notice, failure to consider the heirs’ objection, absence of consent from the rightful owners, and non‑deposit of compensation. The will of Subbakkal was deemed valid, making the heirs the owners. Since the acquisition officer’s award was not accompanied by the statutory deposit, it was null and void. Consequently, the notification and award were quashed.",

The mother of \nthe first Petitioner had executed a Will in favour of the first Petitioner \nand her three sisters with condition that the life estate being granted \nto their father.  Subsequent to the death of their father, the property \ndevolved  to the Petitioners.  There were about 44 h ouses in the \n3/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nproperty including the houses of the first Petition er and her sisters. \nThe tenants in the houses belong to Scheduled Caste  community. \nThey were working in the mills in Coimbatore and we re paying rent \nto the father of the Petitioners during his life ti me.  Therefore, the \nfirst Petitioner and her sisters had been benefited  from the income \nfrom the houses.  The Government invariably acquired  lands in the \nvillages for public purposes where there are no hou ses. Here, the \nproperty had houses where harijans were residing.  Therefore, the \nhusband of the first Petitioner viz., Palanisamy Gou nder had objected \nto the notice sent to the persons in possession of the properties, as \nper the then prevailing Land Acquisition Act, 1894,  stating that there \nare houses where there are tenants and from the ten ants, the owner \nof the property derived income for his family expen ses.  Therefore, it \ncannot be acquired.   Also,  he had  given  instances  w here  earlier \nacquisitions were held in Coimbatore outside the li mits of the Town. \nIgnoring the objections of the husband of the first  Petitioner, the \nthird  Respondent  acquired  the  lands  and  reported  to  the  second \nRespondent Collector.  Based on the recommendation of the second \nRespondent,  the  first  Respondent  had  notified  the  s ame  in  the \ngazette.  Therefore, the Petitioners  had approached this  Court to \nquash the gazette notification acquiring  the propert y where there \nwere buildings and tenants are residing which incom e was used for \n4/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nthe Petitioners' family.  The Writ Court allowed th e Writ Petition and \nquashed the Government notification acquiring proper ty belonging to \nthe family of the Petitioners.\n3.Aggrieved by the same, the State preferred Writ A ppeal.  In \nthe Writ Appeal, the order passed by the learned Si ngle Judge was \nreversed and was set aside.  Therefore, the Petitio ners in the Writ \nPetition who are the Respondents in the Writ Appeal  filed Review \nPetition.  The Review Petition was also dismissed.  Therefore, the \nowner  of  the  property  had  moved  Special  Leave  Petit ion  (Civil \nAppeal) before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.  The Hon' ble Supreme \nCourt had passed orders remanding the matter back t o the Division \nBench of this Court to consider the arguments of bo th parties and \npass fresh orders. Therefore, the Writ Petition is before this Division \nBench.  In the meanwhile, the first, second and thi rd Petitioners in \nthe Writ Petition viz., Rukmani, Lakshmi and Nachim uthu Gounder \ndied and their legal heirs have been impleaded as P etitioners 5 to 7. \n4.The  properties  originally  belonged  to  Subbakkal, \nW/o.Kaliappa Gounder.  Subbakkal is the mother of t he Petitioners 1 \nto  3  herein.  She  had  executed  a  Will  whereby  the  pr operties \nbelonging to her was allotted to her legal heirs af ter her life time. \n5/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nShe had retained the life estate for maintenance of  herself and her \nhusband  Kaliappa  Gounder.   The  land  acquisition  proc eedings \ncommenced on the ground that the land owner Kaliapp a Gounder \ngiven his consent for the land acquisition proceedi ngs.  The husband \nof Subbakkal viz., Kaliappa Gounder did not have abs olute right in \nthe properties.  Therefore, he has no right to give  consent for the \nland acquisition.  The Land Acquisition Authorities  under the Land \nAcquisition Act, 1894 had not considered that there  was partition \nregarding  the  properties  and  the  Will  executed  by  S ubbakkal  in \nfavour of the legal heirs.  Therefore, the legal he irs of Subbakkal \nobjected to the land acquisition proceedings as the y are the original \nowners of the properties.  Their objection was not considered.\n5.It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  t he  Writ \nPetitioners that as per the provisions of the then Land Acquisition \nAct,  1894,  there  shall  be  clear  notice  of  60  days  t o  the  land \nacquisition  notification  seeking  objection  from  the  owner  of  the \nproperty. After this notice and after hearing the o bjection, the Land \nAcquisition Officer who is the Collector, but as pe r the Act, it is the \nTahsildar who is exercising the powers of the Colle ctor in Tamil Nadu, \nhad made recommendation rejecting the objection for  acquiring the \nlands as per Section 6(1) of the then Land Acquisiti on Act, 1894, \n6/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nwhich is against the provisions of the Land Acquisi tion Act, 1894. \nTherefore,  the  conduct  of  the  third  Respondent  was  against  the \nprovisions of the then prevailing Land Acquisition Act, 1894.  Further, \nwhen the land or properties were acquired for publi c purpose, even \nthough there is objection by the owner of the prope rty, the Land \nAcquisition Officer had to deposit the compensation  amount in the \nCourt having jurisdiction over the land acquisition  proceedings.  In \nthis  case,  no  amount  was  deposited.   Further,  there  was  a \ncorrespondence between the Collector and the Governm ent that as \non the date of acquisition of the property, enough fund was not \navailable with the Collector to pay compensation to  the land loser. \nTherefore, the Collector recommended for cancellati on of the scheme. \nIn the light of the same, the Writ Court had quashe d the notification \nissued by the Government in the gazette of Tamil Nad u notifying the \nAcquisition  of  the  land/property  belonging  to  Petit ioners  at \nGanapathy  Village  in  Coimbatore  District.   But,  till  date,  the \nGovernment has not deposited any amount.  Therefore,  in the light of \nthe  fact  that  the  Government  has  not  deposited  the  a mount  of \ncompensation till date, the Writ Petitioners had lo st their income.  In \nthe meanwhile, the Writ Petitioners approached the Civil Court and \nfiled a suit for eviction against the tenants who w ere working in the \nmills in Coimbatore and who belong to Scheduled Cas te community. \n7/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nThe suit was decreed in favour of the owner of the properties. As the \nproceedings in the land acquisition were challenged  and the matter \nwas in the Court, the Writ Petitioners, who are the  landlords/owners \nof  the  property  is  waiting  for  execution  proceeding s  against  the \ntenants.  Therefore, the notification is to be quas hed and the Writ \nPetition is to be allowed.  \n6.Further,  as  per  the  then  prevailing  Land  Acquisiti on  Act, \n1894, the Land Acquisition Officer had passed the a ward directing \ncompensation to the land loser but till date the co mpensation amount \nhad not been deposited.  Therefore, the award passe d by the Land \nAcquisition Officer is null and void.  \n7.It is the further contention of the learned Couns el for the \nPetitioners that Nachimuthu Gounder objected to the land acquisition \nin Survey No.141/2 in Ganapathy Village on the groun d that in the \nland  proposed  to  be  acquired,  there  were  buildings  which  were \nalready  let out on rent for eking  out his  livelihood.  Exce pt  this \nland/house site, he does not own any other property .  He depends on \nthe rent from this property for his livelihood.  Su bsequent to his \ndeath, his legal heirs have been in possession and enjoyment of the \nsame.  Therefore, that is the only property owned b y them on which \n8/37\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\nW.P.No.5220 of 1987\nthey depend on their livelihood and there are prope rties available \noutside the Town that can be acquired by the Land A cquisition Officer \nfor putting up construction for the landless Harija ns.  This objection \nwas not at all considered by the Authorities.\n8.It is the further submission of the learned Couns el for the \nPetitioners  that proper  enquiry  was  not at all  cond ucted  and no \ncompensation  was  paid  to  Nachimuthu  Gounder  or  to  h is  Legal \nheirs/Petitioners herein.  Those who are residing i n the buildings in \nSurvey  No.141/2  are  Harijans  who  are  employed  in  th e  Mills  at \nCoimbatore and getting regular monthly salary.  The refore, they are \nnot landless  poor people.  Further  the then  District  Collector  had \naddressed the Government regarding the objection of Nachimuthu \nGounder  as  well  as  the  compensation  amount  not  havin g  been \ndeposited towards compensation  after the award was  passed.  Mean \nwhile, the owner of the land/property had addressed  the Government \nto release the land acquired by the Government.\n9.Mr.R.N.Amarnath,  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petition ers  had \nrelied on the following rulings:\n(i)  (201",

Ganesha @ Ganesan (A1), both employees of Aavin Co‑operative Milk Society, Vellore, seeking bail under Sec. 439 CrPC in Crime No.22 of 2020. The prosecution alleged that the petitioners demanded a bribe of Rs.1,81,000 from a milk transporter and that A2 was caught red‑handed, leading to A1's arrest based on A2’s confession. The petitioners contended they received the money as a loan and were falsely implicated due to personal enmity, asserting that the investigation was almost complete. The Additional Public Prosecutor opposed bail, emphasizing the seriousness of the alleged corruption. The Court, noting the prolonged judicial custody (over a month), the near‑completion of investigation, and the lack of necessity for further custodial interrogation, granted bail subject to stringent conditions, including a bond of Rs.10,000, surety requirements, daily reporting, and prohibitions against absconding, tampering with evidence, or committing similar offences. The order also referenced the Supreme Court’s guidelines in P.K. Shaji v. State of Kerala. The bail was thus allowed with conditions to ensure compliance during the remaining investigation and trial.",

    "arguments": "Petitioners argued innocence, claiming the money was a loan, that they were falsely implicated due to prior enmity, and that continued custody was unnecessary given the investigation’s advanced stage.

They were\narrested  and  remanded  to  judicial  custody  on  23.12.2020  and\n24.12.2020 respectively for the offence punishable under Section 7(a)\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and amended Act 2018 in\nCrime No.22 of 2020, and now, they have filed this petition seeking\nfor bail.\n2.  The case of the prosecution is that A1 in this case is\nworking as a General Manager of Aavin Co-operative Milk Society,\nVellore, and A2 is working as a Manager of Aavin Co-operative Milk\nSociety, Vellore. The defacto complainant is a transporter of the\nmilk from Tiruvannamalai to various places at Vellore, in which Aavin\nCo-operative Society has to pay a sum of Rs.1,81,000/- to him. When\nhe has requested the petitioners to pay that amount, they have\ndemanded some amount as a bribe. Hence, based on the complaint of\ndefacto complainant, a  trap was arranged, in which, A2, who has\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nreceived the amount has got red handed and he was arrested on\n23.12.2020. Subsequently, based on the confession of A2 that on\nbehalf of A1, General Manager of the society, he has received that\namount, hence, A1 was also arrayed as accused and arrested on\n23.12.2020. Now, the present petitions have been filed seeking bail. \n3. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the\npetitioners  are  innocent  persons  and  they  have  been  falsely\nimplicated in this case. He would submit that they have not received\nany amount as a bribe, it was received only as a loan and only due to\nprevious enmity, they have been falsely implicated. That apart, he\nhas stated that almost investigation is over.  Hence, he prays for\ngrant of bail to the petitioners. \n4.The learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that\nboth the petitioners are working as General Manager and Manager of\nAavin Co-operative Milk Society. She would submit that for settling\nthe amount due to the defacto complainant, they have demanded bribe\nand A2 has got red handed. She would submit that only at the\ninstigation of A1, A2 has received the amount and both were arrested.\nHence, she opposed to grant bail to the petitioner. \n5.

The jewellery was originally mortgaged for house construction, but the construction never materialised and the daughter‑in‑law committed suicide. Villagers repaid the loan in full and requested redemption of the jewellery, yet the bank refused to return it. The petitioner submitted a representation dated 16‑11‑2021 requesting the bank to deposit the value for the minors, but received no response. The court, after hearing counsel, directed the petitioner to forward the representation along with her Aadhaar, ration card and legal heir certificate, and to execute an indemnity bond. Upon receipt, the bank must consider the case and either return the jewellery or deposit its value for the minors within a week. The petition was disposed with this direction and no costs were awarded.",

The daughter‑in‑law had mortgaged nine sovereigns of gold jewellery with Indian Bank for house construction, which never occurred. Villagers repaid the loan in full and asked the bank to release the jewellery to Parvathi. The bank retained the jewellery. On 16‑11‑2021 Parvathi sent a representation requesting the bank to deposit the jewellery’s value in the minors’ names and pay monthly interest. No order was issued, prompting the writ petition.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner’s counsel argued that equity and the bank’s own receipt of full repayment compel the bank to either return the jewellery or deposit its value for the minors.

    "judgment_reasoning": "The court noted that the petitioner had complied with the substantive requirement of repaying the loan and that the bank’s refusal to return the jewellery lacked legal basis. However, the court emphasized the need for proper documentation to protect the bank’s interests. Consequently, it directed the petitioner to submit the representation, Aadhaar, ration card, and legal heir certificate, and to execute an indemnity bond.

Sanjai and Viswa, sons of Late Jayaraman and\nKasiyammal (Guardian Parvathi) and disburse the interest to the\nminor children in every month or return back nine sovereigns of\njewels to the minor children.  \nFor Petitioners : Mr.C.Prakasam\nFor Respondents : Ms.S.R.Sumathy\nO R D E R\nPetitioner has come up with the present Writ Petition\nseeking a direction to the Respondents either to deposit the\nvalue of the nine sovereigns of jewels in their Bank in the name\nof the minor children viz. Sanjai and Viswa, sons of Late\nJayaraman and Kasiyammal, and disburse the interest to the minor\nchildren every month or return back nine sovereigns of jewels to\nthe minor children.  \n2. It is stated by the Petitioner that, her son viz.\nJayaraman married one Kasiyammal and through the wedlock, they\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nhave two male children, aged 5 and 3 years.  As both her son and\ndaughter-in-law committed suicide, the Petitioner is taking care\nof the two minor children, by doing coolie work.  It is further\nstated by the Petitioner that, when her daughter-in-law was\nalive,  she  mortgaged  her  nine  sovereigns  jewels  with  the\nRespondent Bank for construction of house.  But, she could not\nconstruct the house and in the meantime, she committed suicide.\nHowever, considering the pitiable situation of the Petitioner's\nfamily, the Village people came forward to settle the loan\namount with the Respondent Bank and they repaid the entire loan\namount with the Respondent Bank with a request to redeem the\njewels to the Petitioner.  Even after receiving the principal\namount and the entire interest, as the Respondent Bank is not\ninclined  to  return  the  jewels,  the  Petitioner  made  a\nrepresentation  dated  16.11.2021  to  the  Respondent  Bank\nrequesting them to deposit the value of nine sovereigns of gold\njewellery in the name of the minor children,  as she has no\nother source of income to feed the children. As no orders are\npassed on her representation, having no other alternative, the\nPetitioner is before this Court with the above Writ Petition.\n3. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that, a\ndirection may be issued to the Respondent Bank to consider the\nPetitioner's case and return the gold jewellery to her or\ndeposit the value of the gold jewellery in the names of the\nPetitioner's minor grand-children.  \n4. Learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Respondent\nBank submitted that, the Petitioner may be directed to send a\ncopy of the representation dated 16.11.2021 along with a copy of\nher Aadhar Card, Ration Card and Legal Heir Certificate to the\nRespondent Bank to enable them to return the gold jewellery to\nher, within a stipulated period.\n5.

    "summary": "On 6 January 2022 the Madras High Court heard W.P. No.37 of 2022 filed by S. Uma seeking a writ of mandamus under Article 226 directing the District Revenue Officer, Salem, to release a lorry (Regn. No. TN-25-M-9696) seized by the Inspector of Police, Civil Supplies CID, on 17 December 2021 on suspicion of illegal PDS rice transport. The petitioner claimed the vehicle remained idle and offered to deposit Rs.2,00,000 to facilitate its release. The respondents raised no substantive objection. The Court noted that the seizure was premised on alleged illegal activity but, with no further evidence and the vehicle lying idle, continued detention served no purpose. Accordingly, the Court directed the release of the lorry subject to conditions: the petitioner must deposit Rs.2,00,000 within two weeks, appear in person with ownership documents, and the respondent must release the vehicle within one week of receipt of payment; the petitioner must not use the vehicle for unlawful purposes or alienate it during proceedings, and the respondent may initiate appropriate legal action thereafter. The writ petition was disposed of with these directions and no costs were awarded.",
    "facts": "The lorry bearing registration TN-25-M-9696 was seized on 17-12-2021 by the Inspector of Police, Civil Supplies CID, Salem on the allegation of illegal transportation of PDS rice. The petitioner, S. Uma, filed a representation with the District Revenue Officer seeking release of the vehicle, which remained unconsidered. Consequently, a writ petition under Article 226 was filed requesting a mandamus directing release of the lorry.",
    "arguments": "Petitioner argued that the vehicle was idle, offered to deposit Rs.2,00,000 to secure its release, and sought a mandamus directing the respondent to consider the representation. Respondents, represented by the Additional Government Pleader, raised no serious objection to the petitioner's proposal.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court held that continued seizure of an idle vehicle served no public interest. While acknowledging the initial allegation of illegal transport, the lack of further evidence and the petitioner's willingness to deposit a sum justified release. The Court therefore granted the writ of mandamus with conditions to ensure ownership verification, prevent misuse, and preserve the respondent's right to pursue appropriate legal action.",

The petitioner made\nrepresentation to the 1st respondent seeking to release his\nvehicle and since the same has not yet been considered.

    "summary": "The petitioner Kalyankumar filed W.P. No.417 of 2021 and W.M.P. No.499 of 2021 under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking a writ of certiorari and mandamus to quash a settlement deed dated 16 November 2020 (document No.3561/2020) registered by the Sub‑Registrar, Vikravandi, and to direct the Registrar of Registrations to delete the encumbrance entry relating to that deed. The property in question (S.No.313/8, old S.No.187/4) originally belonged to the petitioner’s father and was adjudicated in his favour in a suit (O.S. No.230 of 1991) which culminated in a decree on 17 April 1995, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2015 (SLA No. C.23245 of 2008). The petitioner’s mother later executed a settlement deed in 2015 (document No.2376/2015) confirming the title. The fourth respondent, Lakshmi Ammal, claimed title based on a sale deed dated 7 November 1991 (document No.462/1991) and executed a new settlement deed in 2020 in favour of the fifth respondent, Senthilkumar. The Registrar, after investigation, found the 2020 deed improperly registered and ordered its removal from the encumbrance. The High Court upheld this finding, directing the Registrar to delete the 2020 entry, thereby granting the petitioner’s relief and disposing of the writ petition.",
    "facts": "The property at Mundiyambakkam Village, Vikravandi Taluk was originally owned by the petitioner’s father. After his death, the petitioner and his mother sued the fourth respondent (Lakshmi Ammal) in O.S. No.230 of 1991 for declaration and injunction. The trial court decreed in favour of the petitioner in 1993 and the appellate court affirmed the decree in 1995. The Supreme Court upheld the decree in 2015 (SLA No. C.23245 of 2008). The petitioner’s mother executed a settlement deed in 2015 (doc No.2376/2015) and obtained a patta. Despite this, Lakshmi Ammal executed a settlement deed on 16 November 2020 (doc No.3561/2020) in favour of Senthilkumar and sought registration. The Registrar, after a detailed enquiry, found the 2020 deed inconsistent with the earlier judgments and ordered its removal from the encumbrance register.",
    "arguments": "The petitioner argued that the 2020 settlement deed was void because the fourth respondent had no title over the property, which had already been adjudicated in favour of the petitioner’s mother and recorded in the 2015 settlement deed and patta. The fourth respondent contended that she derived title from a sale deed dated 7 November 1991 and that the 2020 deed was a legitimate transfer to the fifth respondent. The Registrar’s report supported the petitioner’s claim, stating that the 2020 deed was improperly registered and contravened the circular issued by the Registrar of Registrations.",
    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court examined the chain of title, noting that the 1991 suit and subsequent decrees conclusively established the petitioner’s mother’s ownership. The 2015 settlement deed further reinforced that title.

The  case  of  the  petitioner  is  that  the  property\ncomprised in S.No.313/8 old S.No.187/4, ad measuring 200 sq.mtrs\nsituated at Mundiyambakkam Village, Vikravandi Taluk, originally\nbelonged to the father of the petitioner. However, the fourth\nrespondent claims right over the said property and attempted to\nintercept there on. Therefore after demise of his father, the\npetitioner and his mother filed suit in O.S.No.230 of 1991 on\nthe file of the Principal District Munsif, Villupuram, for\ndeclaration and injunction in respect of the said property along\nwith other properties comprised in natham S.No.313/8. The fourth\nrespondent herein was the third defendant in the said suit and\nshe contested the said suit. The said suit was initially decreed\nin respect of the first item of the property by the judgment\ndecree  dated  30.08.1993.  However,  the  entire  property  was\ndecreed by the judgment and decree dated 17.04.1995 by the\nappellate Court in A.S.No.307 of 1994 on the file of the\nPrincipal District Court, Villupuram and it is upheld by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India by an order dated 23.03.2015 in\nSpecial Leave to Appeal (C).23245 of 2008. \n3. Thereafter, the fourth respondent herein did not allow\nto implement the decree. As such the petitioner filed petition\nin E.A.No.717 of 2007 in O.S.No.230 of 1991, seeking police aid\nto implement the order of injunction. Though the petition was\ndismissed on 06.12.2007, the said order was set aside by this\nCourt in C.R.P.No.1 of 2008. Thereafter, the petitioner was put\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nin possession and he put up compound wall in and around the\nsubject property. Further the fourth respondent filed a review\npetition in Review Application No.32 of 2008 as against the\norder passed in the Civil Revision Petition and the same was\nalso dismissed by this Court by an order dated 04.03.2008. In\nthe mean time, patta was issued in favour of the petitioner's\nmother in patta No.549. The said patta was challenged by the\nfourth  respondent  before  the  Assistant  Settlement  Officer,\nTiruvanamalai, and the same was also dismissed on 18.09.1996.\nAggrieved by the same the fourth respondent filed revision\nbefore the District Revenue Officer and the same was also\ndismissed by an order dated 31.03.1999 and it became final. \n4. While  being  so,  the  petitioner's  mother  executed\nSettlement  Deed  dated  30.06.2015  registered  vide  document\nNo.2376 of 2015 on the file of the third respondent in favour of\nthe  petitioner.  While  presenting  the  Settlement  Deed  for\nregistration,  to  prove  the  title  over  the  property,  the\npetitioner and his mother produced all the judgments and decrees\npassed in their favour and also the patta issued in the mother's\nname. All the documents were part and parcel of the Settlement\nDeed. After execution of the settlement deed, the petitioner was\nissued patta in Patta No.549 and thereafter, the petitioner is\nin possession and enjoyment of the subject property. \n5. On the other hand, the fourth respondent claimed title\nover the property on the strength of the sale deed dated\n07.11.1991 registered vide document No.462 of 1991. However, the\ntitle was declared in favour of the petitioner and his mother in\nthe suit filed by them in O.S.No.230 of 1991. Further the fourth\nrespondent executed Settlement Deed in favour of the fifth\nrespondent on 16.11.2020 and presented the same before the third\nrespondent for registration and the same was also registered in\ndocument No.3561 of 2020. Therefore, the petitioner filed this\nWrit Petition, challenging the impugned Settlement Deed dated\n16.11.2020 and sought for a direction to the third respondent to\nremove the entry in encumbrance in respect of the subject\nproperty. \n6. Heard Mr.N.Suresh, learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner, Mr.Yogesh Kannadasan, learned Government Advocate\nappearing for the respondents 1 to 3 and Mr.V.Tamizhanban,\nlearned counsel appearing for the respondents 4 & 5. \n7. While pending the Writ Petition, the petitioner lodged\ncomplaint before the second respondent and on receipt of the\nsame, the second respondent, conducted detailed enquiry. The\nsecond  respondent  also  called  for  report  from  the  third\nrespondent. \nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n8. On perusal of report reveals that on receipt of the\nsettlement deed executed by the fourth respondent in favour of\nthe fifth respondent, the third respondent verified the document\nand it was found that the fourth respondent claimed the subject\nproperty together with bore well, electricity service connection\nand claimed that the said property was purchased from one\nS.Chockalingam by the sale deed dated 07.11.1997 registered vide\ndocument No.462 of 1991. The said document was verified and\nfound  that  the  said  S.Chockalingam  had  purchased  the  said\nproperty from one R.Chandramoorthy, under the sale deed dated\n28.08.1986  registered  vide  document  No.1787  of  1986.  On\nverification of the said document, it was found that the said\nR.Chandramoorthy  had  purchased  the  said  property  in  public\nauction in O.S.No.497 of 1979 on the file of the District Munsif\nCourt, Villupuram in E.P.No.193 of 1984. The said sale was\nconfirmed, as per the sale certificate dated 13.03.1985. On the\nbasis of those documents, the third respondent registered the\nsettlement deed presented by the fourth respondent in favour of\nthe fifth respondent. Therefore, the third respondent has no\nother reason to register the sale deed including the settlement\ndeed executed in favour of the petitioner by his mother in the\nyear, 2015 registered vide document No.2376 of 2015. \n9. On the basis of the said report, the second respondent\npassed orders on 03.05.2021 and concluded that the sale deed\nregistered vide document No.462 of 1991 and the settlement deed\nexecuted by the petitioner's mother vide document No.2376 of\n2015 and the settlement deed executed by the fourth respondent\nin favour of the fifth respondent vide document No.3561 of 2020\nare wrongly registered and the same is against the circular\nissued by the first respondent, and therefore, directed the\nthird respondent to make entry in the encumbrance in respect of\nthe aforesaid documents. \n10. It is also seen that the petitioner filed petition in\nE.A.No.717 of 2007 in O.S.No.230 of 1991 on the file of the\nDistrict  Munsif  Court,  Vikkiravandi,  seeking  police  aid  to\nimplement the decree of injunction granted in O.S.No.230 of 1991\nand the same was allowed. Aggrieved by the same the fifth\nrespondent herein preferred a Civil Revision Petition and the\nsame is pending in C.R.P.No.1931 of 2021. That apart, the fifth\nrespondent also filed suit in O.S.No.310 of 2021 on the file of\nthe Sub Court, Villupuram and it is pending for adjudication.\n11. On perusal of the judgments and decrees passed in\nfavour of the petitioner's mother in O.S.No.230 of 1991 revealed\nthat the petitioner's mother had title over the property and on\nthe strength of the same, she executed settlement deed in favour\nof the petitioner. Even then, the fourth respondent executed\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\nsettlement  deed  in  favour  of  the  fifth  respondent  on  the\nstrength of the sale deed dated 07.11.1991 registered vide\ndocument No.462 of 1991. \n12. Therefore, the fourth respondent has no right or title\nover the subject property to execute the settlement deed in\nfavour of the fifth respondent and it is non-est in the eye of\nlaw. Accordingly, the third respondent is directed to make entry\nin encumbrance in respect of the subject property by removing\nthe entry of the settlement deed dated 16.11.2020 registered\nvide document No.3561 of 2020. \n13. With the above directions, this Writ Petition stands\ndisposed of. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is\nclosed.

    "summary": "The petition, filed on 19 February 2021 before the Madras High Court, sought quashing of criminal proceedings (D.V.A. No.3 of 2015) pending before Judicial Magistrate No.5, Coimbatore, invoking the inherent powers of the Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioners—six individuals—asserted that the dispute had been settled before the trial court, rendering the petition infructuous. The respondent, Dr. M. Krishnaveni, was the sole opposing party. The learned counsel for the petitioners emphasized the settlement and requested dismissal of the petition and closure of the connected miscellaneous petition. The Court, after considering the submission, held that where the parties have settled the matter, the High Court’s power to interfere under Section 482 is not exercisable, and the petition stands dismissed as infructuous. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition was also closed. The order reflects the Court’s adherence to the principle that the inherent jurisdiction to quash proceedings is to be exercised sparingly and only when necessary to prevent abuse of process, not where the dispute has already been resolved between the parties.",

    "judgment_reasoning": "The Court observed that the parties had settled the dispute, making the petition infructuous.

Heard, Mr.A.Muthukumar, learned counsel appearing\nfor the petitioners and Mr.Yogesh Kannadasan, learned Special\nGovernment Pleader appearing for the respondents 1 to 3.\n3.  The case of the petitioner is that the property,\ncomprised in survey No.116/2 and New survey No.484/1 to an\nextent of 40 cents, owned by the petitioners.   The fourth\nrespondent instituted a suit in O.S.No.3 of 2011 on the file of\nthe  II  Additional  District  Court,  Chidambaram,  against  the\npetitioners  for  specific  performance  on  the  basis  of  the\nagreement  for  sale  dated  04.04.2008  along  with  alternative\nremedy to refund a sum of Rs.18,00,000/- with interest at the\nrate of 12% per annum.    The said suit was dismissed by a\nJudgment and Decree dated 24.07.2015.  However, the petitioners\nwere directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest at the\nrate of 12% per annum from 05.04.2009 till the date of payment.\nThere is no appeal as against the said Judgment and Decree,\neither by the petitioners or by the fourth respondent herein.\n4.    As directed by the Court below, the petitioners\nalso deposited the amount to the credit of O.S.No.3 of 2011.\nThereafter, the petitioners obtained a certified copy of the\nJudgment and Decree passed in O.S.No.3 of  2011 and presented\nfor registration before the third respondent.  However, the\nthird respondent refused to register the Judgment and Decree for\nthe reason that the decree could not be registered after a\nperiod of four months from the date of Decree.\n5.   This Court repeatedly held that the provisions under\nSections  23  and  25  of  the  Indian  Registration  Act,  which\nprescribes  limitation,  will  not  apply  in  the  case  of\nregistration of any Civil Court Decree.  Since, the decree is\nnot  a  compulsorily  registrable  document  and  the  limitation\nprescribed under the Registration Act would not stand attracted\nfor registering any decree.   Therefore, the third respondent\ncannot refuse to registration of the Court Decree on the ground\nof limitation.\n6.   In view of the above, the petitioners are directed\nto present the Judgment and Decree passed in O.S.No.3 of 2011\ndated 24.07.2015 for registration before the third respondent\nhttps://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/hcservices/\n\nand on receipt of the same, the third respondent is directed to\nregister and release the same forthwith.\n7.
